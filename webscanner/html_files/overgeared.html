<p> </p><h2>Chapter 1525</h2> <p></p><p> The ground on which Grid stood lost its shape. Every time he took a step, it was crushed. There was bound to be strength. It was because he had to repeat the position change that reversed his field of view with one step.
</p><p> Grid was wary of Gamigin’s charge. He tried not to face Gamigin in a straight line. It was up and down in all directions. Grid’s field of view that managed to face all sides every second represented how intense his movements were. The orange glow, which was gradually growing darker, eventually expanded like the sun.
</p><p> Grid’s cloak fluttered in a dizzying manner. It was due to the wind pressure caused by Gamigin’s forehead passing by. Grid avoided the attack by a difference that was a single sheet of paper.
</p><p> ‘Certainly, the charging speed is the best.’
</p><p> Gamigin’s four-legged charge was as natural and fast as running water. It was an area of supersonic speed and was reminiscent of Zeratul. It was definitely faster compared to when she fought Braham. Still, there was nothing to be flustered about. It was a situation he had predicted from the time she appeared with the souls of legends. Even Judar had intervened.
</p><p> Gamigin had returned in a stronger state. It was the reason why Braham avoided a confrontation.
</p><p> ‘It is okay.’
</p><p> Grid held his sword to Gamigin’s throat as she passed by and bent his wrist vigorously. He slashed Gamigin’s throat and guided her head in the direction he wanted. He offset the fog-like demonic energy with Storm of the Fire God and greeted the physical attacks.
</p><p> It was a waste of time to avoid the attacks. Evasive opportunities would consume counterattack opportunities. Of course, fatal attacks were avoided. Grid was able to distinguish the trajectories and strength of the incoming attacks. The 30 God Hands were maintaining the ‘artificial senses.’ Gamigin’s charging attacks were meaningless even if they broke through supersonic speed.
</p><p> In the first place, Gamigin had a big weakness. Thanks to the horse-like lower body, she specialized in linear movements while the direction change was slow. Of course, it would seem very quick to the average person, but it was definitely substandard to Grid. He had dealt with great talents. His experience with difficult battles had accumulated so much that it was sad.
</p><p> Gujel’s Dao, which specialized in both slashing and stabbing after it was combined with the Fire Dragon Sword—the moment it touched Gamigin’s throat, an explosion occurred. It was the sound of the absolute defense being broken. Grid’s original fighting energy and Gujel’s Dao showed an outstanding combination. There was a high probability of breaking the absolute defense. In this way, it was possible to deal a serious injury even if he couldn’t raid a dragon. This was the level he evaluated himself.
</p><p> Five minutes. In fact, Gamigin became bloody just five minutes after the battle began. She was the 4th Great Demon, so her health would be ‘at least’ in the billions.
</p><p> Grid’s attack power was at the level where calling it transcendent was lacking. It was a fraudulent level. It was safe to say it was at the level of a bug. It was at the peak due to items. Grid’s achievements, titles, status, and stats raised the strongest weapon, the dragon weapon, to the limit.
</p><p> “Sigh…” Gamigin breathed out heavily and her expression was surprisingly calm. The stronger the crisis, the calmer she became.
</p><p> ‘There must be something that she believes in.’
</p><p> Grid’s head was hot because he went through hundreds of visual changes per minute. His body wasn’t tired, but his mental fatigue was considerable. This was one of the reasons why Satisfy was so difficult. The higher the physical ability, the greater the price to the players. It was impossible to maintain concentration for a long time. It was a side effect of suppressing the system’s assistance effect as much as possible to increase the sense of realism.
</p><p> However, Grid was okay. He could handle mental fatigue as much as physical fatigue, unless there were system constraints such as his stamina running out.
</p><p> Persistence—this was Grid’s biggest strength.
</p><p> ‘She probably has a means of overcoming her weakness.’
</p><p> Grid’s focus, which had reached its peak after the battle began, remained unwavering. He guessed and prepared for what other measures Gamigin had taken. He didn’t make it obvious. He maintained his battle pattern without changing his movements and steadily captured an advantageous position. He didn’t give Gamigin the shortest route forward and constantly stepped to the side, sublimating the process into the sword dances.
</p><p> The magic in the sword dances was influenced by Gujel’s ego. The dragon’s roar stiffened the surrounding demonic creatures. It was incomplete, but it was Dragon Fear. Enemies that were one stage lower or significantly lower statuses than Grid lost their fighting power in front of the fear. The duration was only one second, but this was virtually meaningless. The magic of the sword dances continued to be linked and the duration of Dragon Fear increased.
</p><p> When the sword wielding Grid appeared at Gamigin’s lower left, new blood gushed from Gamigin’s chest and back at the same time. It was a swift sword technique that made his allies cheer.
</p><p> “……!” On the other hand, a chill went down Braham’s spine. He was looking up at Grid while tying up Tzudan and Filewolf. He could see a smile spreading on Gamigin’s face. There was no time for him to shout. He immediately cast a shield that covered Grid’s entire body. However, there were already dark rays being fired from Gamigin’s arms.
</p><p> It was the moment when Gamigin’s weaknesses that were relentlessly targeted by Grid, the blind spots at her flank, were turned into sharp weapons.
</p><p> “……!”
</p><p> “……!”
</p><p> The eight rays of light centered from Gamigin exerted unimaginable power. From above, it looked like a crystal with black eyes. Yet unlike its mysterious and beautiful appearance, it produced terrible results. The players and demonic creatures in the path of the rays turned to ash without a trace. Defensive skills and magic were useless. It was an instant death with just a passing hit.
</p><p> Additionally, the range was large. One ray was tens of meters in diameter and the flying distance was tens of kilometers. This meant that the battlefield had become devastated in the aftermath of a single ray of light.
</p><p> Grid encountered the rays from right in front of him and couldn’t dodge. The moment his transcendent senses were activated, his entire field of view was already covered by rays, so it was impossible to initiate Shunpo. Instead, he responded with Revolve. There was no delay because he had predicted a counterattack. Gujel’s Dao immediately rotated and accurately hit the rays. Still, it was just a reversal.
</p><p> [You have suffered 150,000 damage.]

      </div></div><p> There was fixed damage that ignored physical forces and magic power. The rays that penetrated without colliding with the sword dances entered Grid’s entire body. It was high damage that explained why the rankers died immediately. There was something even worse than the rays.
</p><p> [You have suffered 150,000 damage.]
</p><p> It was the structure that overlapped damage until the target was out of range. It was 300,000 damage per second. This was the true value of the 4th ranked Great Demon. This proved that the players weren’t in a position to challenge her hastily.
</p><p> “Kuhahaha!” Gamigin burst out laughing. She maintained the rays that swallowed up Grid and it looked like her 100 years of congestion was gone. In the process, Braham’s magic was allowed one after another. It was inevitable that she would reveal gaps in order to maintain the transcendent power of the rays.
</p><p> She had to deal with it. She gained the power of this dark ray in exchange for belonging to Baal’s faction. According to Baal, it was the power of God Yatan. Of course, it was impossible with Gamigin’s ability to fully unleash and utilize the power, but it was possible to exert sufficient power by mimicking it.
</p><p> The attribute of the rays themselves was unreasonable. They pulled, suppressed, and disintegrated substances with huge masses. At the same time, they completely ignored the inherent resistance of each substance. Once touched by a ray, the object could never escape from it until death.
</p><p> “I… have killed a god! Kuhat! Kuhahahat!”
</p><p> Blood that was like black ink flowed from the seven orifices of her human head as she was unable to stop the light. Her swollen blood vessels burst in a disastrous manner. It wouldn’t be surprising if she died straight away. Of course, she couldn’t die easily. The great demon’s inherent regenerative power and Judar’s power supported her.
</p><p> Just then, there was a strange noise. A portal opened above the wide-eyed Gamigin. Jade-colored magic power poured out like light. It was the return of the hell expedition.
</p><p> “Hell Regulation.”
</p><p> The legendary Demon Slayer was unlikely to be able to influence the power of a god of the beginning. It was impossible even for an ordinary main god. However, the power of the dark rays noticeably weakened. It was due to the environment. Yatan was a god worshipped in hell. The presence of the rays naturally faded the moment hell disappeared from the battlefield.
</p><p> “You…!” Gamigin didn’t stop the rays. In other words, her body that faced the limit was weakened even further by Hell Regulation. Even so, she persevered. It was literally her limit.
</p><p> The battle against Grid was terribly short, but the damage suffered by Gamigin was devastating. There was no sense of reality at all. In fact, all these moments were like a dream for Gamigin. In order to not end this dream as a nightmare, she had to stop Grid’s breathing. If she stepped back here, she wouldn’t get any benefits…
</p><p> “……!” Gamigin’s thoughts stopped for a moment. It was due to the human being who dropped right next to her. It was a man with black hair. Gamigin’s two arms floated over the silvery sword trajectory that followed him like a meteor. “Sword Saint!”
</p><p> “I got involved for no reason.”
</p><p> Click.
</p><p> Kraugel muttered to himself and put away the sword. He put his hand on the sheath that was tied to his waist and took a step back. He seemed to be opening the way for someone. He didn’t care about Gamigin at all.
</p><p> It was a very cheeky attitude, but Gamigin couldn’t afford to be angry. It was because she could feel the heat that was burning her skin. It was heat approaching from beyond the rays that were still being maintained. Looking at it now, the center of the dark rays was burned red. Faint wings were visible. They were wings of fire that couldn’t be extinguished by the rays.
</p><p> “Wh…at…?”
</p><p> The rays might’ve been weakened by Hell Regulation, but they still contained the status of one of the gods of the beginning. Now the center was twisting out of shape. They were melting like they couldn’t handle the heat.
</p><p> Step.Step.Step.
</p><p> The sound of footsteps that didn’t suit the situation gave Gamigin goosebumps. Through the quiet steps, Gamigin realized something. The outcome had been decided from the beginning.
</p><p> “You have become stronger.” Grid appeared through the rays split in half and smiled at Kraugel.
</p><p> The flaming red phoenix was decorating his back as he swung the Falling Moon Sword and Gujel’s Dao sequentially without even looking at Gamigin. It was a sword that aimed for the weaknesses he had targeted since the beginning. The protection of the red phoenix on the two swords and Ruby’s buff offset Judar’s protection that was on Gamigin to a certain extent. The grayish color that mixed with the blood gushing like a fountain announced the news.
</p><p> [The 4th Great Demon, ‘Gamigin,’ has been destroyed.]
</p><p> [It is recorded as defeating a great demon in the shortest time.]
</p><p> [It took only 7 minutes and 31 seconds since the start of the battle to defeat Gamigin. This record was set by Overgeared God Grid.]
</p><p> The new divine sword—it was the moment when the power of the dragon weapon was revealed to the entire world.
</p><p> ***
</p><p> The genre of the world had changed. It was from a despair causing apocalypse to a hack-and-slash full of pleasure. The sight of the remnant of the gray dragon penetrating the battlefield and killing the demonic creatures every time Grid swung his sword gave people an unlimited sense of pleasure. It was a visual drug.
</p><p> 『 U-Uwahhhh! !』
</p><p> Eventually, Gamigin died.
</p><p> The broadcasters got up from their seats and cheered. Even the anchors of the broadcasting stations didn’t care about their appearance and went wild. The expression that the studio was turned upside down was correct. Experts who were previously criticizing each other due to conflicts of opinions now hugged and jumped around.

</p><p> -No, it is crazy ????
</p><p> -This effect of this weapon’s power is too cool…
</p><p> ?This comment will soon be arrested by Peak Sword.
</p><p> ?Why?
</p><p> ?It seems to be because he called it the Japanese slang for cool. (Note: To clarify, the above person used a Japanese word that is used as a slang word for ‘cool’ in South Korea.)
</p><p> ?Doesn’t Peak Sword use battojutsu?
</p><p> ?It isn’t battojutsu, but drawing the sword that is unique to the Korean people.Peak Sword has revealed it in person in the past.There is no basis.
</p><p> ???
</p><p> -Is that a dragon weapon?
</p><p> ?It is unlikely to be a dragon weapon.There is no history of dragons being killed.
</p><p> ? No, no, if you go to the remote mountainous area called Trempit, there is a folk song praising a hero who sealed one 500 years ago.
</p><p> ?That is sealed, not killed.Is this intelligence real?
</p><p> ? Raising my middle finger.
</p><p> -There is a dragon hatchling among Grid’s apostles.It also appeared in the epic.Did he kill her and turn her into a weapon??
</p><p> ?Are you crazy? ????
</p><p> ?It seems so?I think she is the only one I haven’t seen among Grid’s apostles.
</p><p> ?These bastards like Baal.
</p><p> -In any case, it is fXing cool.
Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m</p><p> There was one fact that people realized as they lived. It was the fact that eternal things were rare in the world. People, especially middle-aged people, speculated that even Grid’s invincible myth would have a shelf life. This wasn’t meant to disparage Grid’s skills. They weren’t cursing him because they wanted Grid to be ruined. They were just preparing for the flow that would come naturally.
</p><p> In fact, the enemies kept becoming stronger and eventually the great human and demon war broke out. It was a war of transcendent beings slaughtering thousands. They were all strong existences who threatened the unrivaled Grid. It was a tense situation even for Grid, the supreme one under the sky. They were worried that his reputation that eventually reached a myth would become damaged.
</p><p> In fact, Grid didn’t participate directly in the war.
</p><p> Many people discussed him. They argued if the king should’ve come out directly from the beginning, if the army should’ve been gathered, etc. However, it wasn’t a calm analysis.
</p><p> For players, war was a great opportunity. There was experience everywhere. It was correct to fight for even one more second in the long-term. Yet Grid fled from the war. It was obvious he was nervous. They noticed an extreme reluctance to suffer defeat.
</p><p> The middle-aged players understood Grid’s judgment. Rather, they judged it as appropriate.
</p><p> Grid was the symbol of humanity. If he lost, the momentum of the enemies would go out of control and victory or defeat in the war was likely to be easily concluded. The more people understood Grid’s value, the more they wanted Grid to be cowardly. They hoped he would intervene only when he could aim for a clear victory, holding on to being a disaster to the enemies and hope for his allies.
</p><p> That’s right. The time when Grid fought against Baal. Surprisingly, many people didn’t welcome Grid’s choice. They said he was taking a risk and he was too emotional. Fortunately, he knocked down Baal, but it was just a lucky result. It was because it was a close win. Grid was wounded seriously in that battle. Humanity could lose hope if he wasn’t careful. Then today…
</p><p> Grid once again took risks. He failed to ignore the crisis of thousands of people who were mostly players. Since ancient times, heroes were honest to a fault, but this was too unwise. It wasn’t just one or two people who were worried while watching him.
</p><p> This was until a few seconds ago.
</p><p> -Grid has come back even stronger.
</p><p> -It is thanks to the new divine sword he made.It is really admirable.Haha.I want him to be my son-in-law.
</p><p> -I…If I was 30 years young, I would’ve eaten and fought with Grid.Uhem.Time flies.
</p><p> -My generation should’ve made our kids play games instead of studying.It is my mistake.This way, Grid would be less lonely.I’m really sorry…
</p><p> It was after Gamigin’s fall.
</p><p> The middle-aged players, who were silently watching and evaluating Grid, finally got rid of their useless worries. They were purely enthusiastic and dominated the broadcast’s chat window. The community posts increased in a hurry. It was truly overwhelming firepower that proved the seriousness of the aging society. Some immature young people mocked them using derogatory words for the elderly, but it was only a few.
</p><p> In the first place, they were people who shared the same hobbies and interests. Age wasn’t important. It was the integration of generations. It was a phenomenon that appeared all over the world. Grid had achieved an achievement that no great person had ever achieved.</p>

<p> </p><h2>Chapter 1526</h2> <p></p><p> Gamigin’s soul vault—larger and taller than Baal’s castle, and the expression of Gamigin’s vanity—was brutally torn down. The building that boasted the history of having the largest scale in hell and showed off its dignity had been reduced into an incredibly ugly ruin.
</p><p> “The main obligation ends here.”
</p><p> In the center of the ruins, Leraje stood in a bloody pool. It was a puddle made from the blood flowing from her wounds. It wasn’t that they didn’t intend to stop the bleeding. Kraugel and Yura just didn’t have the means to help her.
</p><p> The body of a great demon was completely different from humans. It wasn’t just the appearance. The structure of the blood vessels and organs in the body were also different. The mucus spreading from her sweat glands and pores and enveloping her dermis proved that she was different from humans. Human cures were useless to her.
</p><p> “Huhu, your facial expressions are strange. Why are you sad just because I’m dying? Rather, it is right to rejoice.” Leraje, who eventually fell down to the ground, laughed in spite of herself.
</p><p> The expressions of Kraugel and Yura reflected in her dark eyes were very stiff. They seemed to be swallowing their pain, so it was strange to her. It was all the more so because they didn’t show their emotions well. Her heart was itchy. Beriache came to mind for some reason.
</p><p> “Cough, cough… Go back. There isn’t anything you can do here… for the time being…”
</p><p> All the hells that could be overcome had been occupied. Half of the hells had gone under Leraje, and Baal’s authority was greatly reduced. Finally, today—
</p><p> Leraje succeeded in not only destroying all of Gamigin’s subordinates, whom even the great demons feared, but also Gamigin’s external heart. This meant she had broken the link between the inherent power that strengthened Gamigin, the souls trapped in the vault, and Gamigin. Gamigin would’ve been greatly weakened.
</p><p> It was the best performance Leraje could do. However, it was somewhat lacking to be called a perfect performance. Just before the heart was destroyed, some of the souls flowed to Gamigin. There were three legendary souls among them. It was a disappointing result for Leraje, who put everything on the line.
</p><p> “Our work means that Gamigin has lost a great deal of her power and combat effectiveness… still, it is unreasonable to think that she is weaker than her prime. As you have experienced… demons belonging to Baal’s faction are protected by some invisible force. It must be Zeratul’s protection. The human world… your world will be in danger…”
</p><p> “Stop.” Kraugel blocked Leraje’s words and laid her straight down. The blood that broke through the pierced chest reddened the mucus on her skin. Perhaps she would die soon.
</p><p> A great demon’s death. It was the death of the 10th Great Demon. It was originally an event to be pleased about. Great demons were humanity’s greatest enemy. Yet on the contrary, Kraugel and Yura’s hearts were heavy. They even felt a faint sadness.
</p><p> Leraje was a great ally. It was infinitely close to a strange fate. The two of them gained too much from being with her. They carried out various communications in the process of cooperating with each other.
</p><p> Kraugel and Yura had noticed it from a certain point. There were emotions such as sadness, disillusionment, and sympathy in the way that Leraje looked at the demons and demonic creatures. It wasn’t just when she was looking at her enemies, but also her own subordinates. Her determination to get revenge on Baal and hell was a heartful, true one.
</p><p> “I trust Youngwoo-ssi,” Yura’s voice awakened Kraugel from his thoughts.
</p><p> “The surface will be safe even if we don’t go back,” Kraugel agreed.
</p><p> It was hard to think of Grid and the Overgeared members losing, even if the demons and demonic creatures had Judar’s protection. Of course, the overall damage would be great. Apart from the Overgeared members and rankers, ordinary people wouldn’t be able to easily target Judar’s protection.
</p><p> Judar’s protection made a target close to invincible. It was difficult to kill them unless the ‘weak spot’ created in specific parts of the body were targeted. Even the positions of the weak spots varied from individual to individual. Depending on the position of the weak spot, it was generally impossible to attack with ordinary skills.
</p><p> Nevertheless, this didn’t mean there was a reason for Kraugel and Yura to return and help right away. It was a matter of efficiency. Even if the two of them went up to the surface, their limit was to protect one battlefield. Of course, that alone could save tens of thousands of lives, but it wasn’t enough of a reason to abandon Leraje.
</p><p> That’s right. Kraugel and Yura intended to stay in hell. It was to protect Leraje by her side as she recovered. This was a personal desire and also a judgment on the whole.
</p><p> Leraje was a must for humanity. In hell, she was like a cancer cell. She was a being who would gradually lead hell to ruin if she lived without dying. Moreover, she knew the past, or the truth, of hell. She had to survive for the new episodes or quests that would occur in the future.
</p><p> “Me too… I know Grid’s skills…” Leraje remembered it. Grid’s swordsmanship that made her use both arms. “Among the overflowing people… a skilled man who raised alertness within me… however, that isn’t enough. Gamigin might’ve lost her power, but with Zeratul’s protection, she will be comparable to being immortal. The fire of life that doesn’t go out will burn until the earth is destroyed. Grid alone won’t be able to stop her…”
</p><p> So you guys should add some strength.
</p><p> Leraje spoke up to here before shutting her mouth. It was because her vocal organs were damaged after her internal injuries worsened. She could barely breathe and her heart was pounding.
</p><p> “……”

      </div></div><p> Kraugel and Yura stood up. They stood back to back as if they were escorting Leraje. Demons who smelled death were flocking. They weren’t Gamigin’s subordinates. All of Gamigin’s demons that were stationed at the soul vault had long been killed.
</p><p> “Are you confident you won’t regret it?” It was Yura’s question.
</p><p> Currently, Kraugel stood at the crossroads of choice. The work of hell was none of the business of the Sword Saint. In the first place, if the great human and demon war was won, then hell wouldn’t be able to intervene on the surface as much as before. Rationally, the best option for him was to kill Leraje directly with his own hands. The prize for killing the 10th Great Demon would be huge.
</p><p> “There are many low quality hyenas everywhere,” Kraugel murmured. It was a rebuke toward the demons who came to target the dying Leraje.
</p><p> This answer was enough. The two people pulled out their swords and grasped them side by side. They became a gateway protecting Leraje.
</p><p> The demons didn’t even snort. There were no signs of fear. Leraje had lost her undefeated reputation. Compared with the performance of destroying Gamigin’s soul vault, the ugliness of retreating several times during the process of destroying the soul vault was more important to the demons. It was because Leraje’s reputation itself was built up on the basis of invincibility.
</p><p> The demons feared her because they thought she was invincible. Now she was no longer invincible and was even dying. She was appetizing. Their eyes were turned so much that they left the Sword Saint and Demon Slayer behind.
</p><p> A fierce exchange of blows began.
</p><p> Kraugel and Yura deftly counterattacked the attacks of dozens of demons and reduced the number. There were thousands of demonic creatures pushing behind the demons like waves, but the two people weren’t shaken. They had reached the state of their mental state being as smooth as a polished mirror.
</p><p> “I told you… to go…” Leraje’s words that she barely let out one syllable at a time permeated the ears of the two people, “Grid… can’t… die…”
Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m</p><p> The biggest reason why Leraje didn’t want Grid to die had nothing to do with favorability. It was because he was the Blood King. He was the key to rallying Beriache’s direct descendants and inserting a knife into Baal’s heart. Leraje was obliged to protect the key. It was because the purpose of her life was to get revenge for Beriache. However, Kraugel and Yura didn’t know the inside story.
</p><p> ‘When did he seduce a great demon?’
</p><p> ‘Does he have a lot of women like this in reality?’
</p><p> The two people misunderstood, but they remained unchanged in their attitude. They trusted Grid and decided it was best to protect Leraje. Their goal was to move her to the black crystal castle. In front of them—
</p><p> “Leave this place to us from now on.”
</p><p> The head of the Overgeared hell branch—the red-skinned demon, Glant, appeared. The manager of the black crystal castle was dispatched to help his superior. He signed a contract with Yura and was reliable. It was the same for the succubi who accompanied him. They were Grid’s subordinates. He couldn’t take them up to the surface because they were sexually suggestive no matter what they wore.
</p><p> “We are good enough for these small fries.”
</p><p> It was shortly after the particularly strong demons were killed by Kraugel and Yura. Additionally, Glant had used the study left behind by Dantalion as the manager of the black crystal castle. It was to carry out the important task of translating the books in demon language into human language. In this process, knowledge was accumulated and he was strengthened. It wasn’t comparable to when he begged Yura for his life.
</p><p> “Please… Grid…” Leraje, who was on Glant’s back, fainted. She worried about Grid until the last minute.
</p><p> By this point, Kraugel and Yura were uneasy.
</p><p> ‘How strong is Gamigin?’
</p><p> Gamigin had already lost to the Braham and Kyle duo. Yet looking back, Gamigin wasn’t accompanied by any legendary souls at the time and it was before she received Judar’s protection.
</p><p> ‘Why is Leraje so concerned? Is the compatibility of Judar’s protection with Gamigin that good?’
</p><p> The two people made a reasonable guess and exchanged looks. In any case, there was no reason for the two of them to remain in hell. Glant carried Leraje on his back and was already breaking through the enemy line. There was no reason for the two of them to challenge areas that even Leraje didn’t dare to target. It was time to return to the surface. Thus, they came back to find…
</p><p> “I got involved for no reason.”
</p><p> Gamigin was on the verge of being defeated. It was in 7 minutes and 31 seconds. In this short time, the 4th ranked Great Demon, who received Judar’s protection, was killed by Grid. If it was to this extent, it was safe to say that Leraje didn’t know Grid’s skills properly.
</p><p> ‘She is the 10th ranked Great Demon.’
</p><p> It might be different when Leraje and Grid first met, but the current Grid was definitely superior to Leraje. This meant that it had become impossible for Leraje to measure Grid. It was natural that Leraje didn’t know. The speed of Grid’s growth was unmatched. Now he had achieved a great growth once again.
</p><p> [Your level has risen.]

      </div></div></div><p> [Your level has risen.]
</p><p> [Your level has ri…]
</p><p> First of all, he gained 26 levels. The experience gauge, which had risen to 90% in the process of making Gujel’s Sword and Dao, became very colorful and beautiful. It was a sight that could only be seen by grid in this world. The normal method that players gained experience was to steadily and slowly fill it up through ‘hunting.’
</p><p> Of course, quests often resulted in multiple level ups at once. Yet even if it was multiple levels, it was still in the single digits. The experience of gaining dozens of levels at once was exclusive to Grid. It was an experience that even chaebols or Youngwoo’s parents didn’t have, despite being armed with legendary items from level 1. There was a limit to the experience gained from monsters.
</p><p> There was no limit only in raids. It wasn’t because the status or level of the raid target was high. It was because they were beings with backgrounds that could influence the worldview. This was even the case despite Gamigin dying right away.
</p><p> The souls of 300 great heroes and nine legends in history were in his grasp. Souls who could exert influence even after their death. What would happen when they were liberated? The world had room for all types of changes. Just like right now.
</p><p> [Gamigin’s death has liberated the soul of the ancient legend, Tzudan.]
</p><p> [Tzudan has expressed his deep gratitude to you. You have received valuable information in return.]
</p><p> [The hidden quest ‘Legend of Five Steps’ has been acquired. A legendary class change book can be obtained with the quest reward.]
</p><p> [Tzudan says he has been in pain for too long and now he wants to rest. However, he remembers being caught by the river of reincarnation, so he can’t believe in ascension. Is there no rest for the dead?]
</p><p> [Gamigin’s death has liberated the soul of the ancient legend, Haksen.]
</p><p> [Haksen has expressed his deep gratitude to you. You have received valuable information in return.]
</p><p> [The hidden quest ‘Forgotten Magic Tower’ has been acquired. A legendary class change book can be obtained with the quest reward.]
</p><p> [Haksen is surprised to see Braham. It is said that this is the ideal he wants to reach. If time permits, he wants to remain in this world and watch Braham.]
</p><p> [Gamigin’s death has liberated the soul of the ancient legend, Filewolf.]
</p><p> [Filewolf has expressed his deep gratitude to you. You have received valuable information in return.]
</p><p> [The hidden quest ‘Iron Filled with Moonlight’ has been acquired. The moon night iron can be secured as a quest reward.]
</p><p> [Filewolf looks at the world where the traces of the giants have disappeared. He wants to rest quickly in order to forget this terrible solitude. However, he is afraid of the river of reincarnation.]
</p><p> [The souls of the forgotten heroes have expressed their deep gratitude to you. The memories of their lifetime are faint. They are sorry that there is nothing they can tell you. If possible, they hope they can stay by your side and help you even a little bit.]
</p><p> The king of souls. The raid rewards were beyond imagination and worthy of an existence with this terrible nickname. The stories that disappeared in history once again reappeared in the world. Grid monopolized all of it. The class change books of the ancient legends and the moon night iron thought to be extinct. Moreover, this wasn’t the end.
</p><p> [The hidden quest ‘Soul Savior’ has been acquired.]
</p><p> [Soul Savior]
</p><p> [Difficulty: ???
</p><p> There are far more legends trapped in Gamigin’s soul vault than you know.
</p><p> Recover the souls scattered all over hell. You are the only resting place for those who are afraid of the river of reincarnation.
</p><p> Currently released legendary souls: 3/9
</p><p> Currently released souls of heroes: 100/300.]
</p><p> The Overgeared God Grid's Techniques included the Granting an Ego skill. It was literally a skill that gave an ego to an item and it was possible to turn an existing item into an ego item. Of course, the higher the level of the ego being granted was, the more powerful the item would be. Depending on the conditions, it could be a concept higher than an ego item. The soul itself was the ingredient needed for Granting an Ego.
</p><p> At this moment, Grid gained enormous resources. Every time he got a legendary soul, he would receive a quest that gave him huge rewards.
</p><p> ‘First of all, the 10 meritorious retainers can all become legends.’
</p><p> He would make the Overgeared Guild invincible. It happened the moment Grid was filled with great ambition…
</p><p> Something was caught in Grid’s artificial senses.</p>

<div></div>
<p> </p><h2>Chapter 1527</h2> <p></p><p> Something was caught in Grid’s artificial senses. One side of the spider-web-like magic power shook through the particles of silver thread. The area was narrow. There wasn’t enough time to accurately determine the size, but he could tell it was a weapon, not a human. In terms of speed, it seemed to be a weapon built to be fired.
</p><p> Grid immediately drew his weapon. It showed a clear difference between a sword and a dao in Satisfy. The stabbing damage was weak, but the speed and power of the ‘first attack’ after drawing the dao was considered an advantage. Moreover, it was Gujel’s Dao.
</p><p> The moment Grid drew his weapon, a half moon sword of light spread over his head like a shroud. Just then—
</p><p> ‘The opposite side?’
</p><p> Grid was startled. He felt a slight fluctuation in magic power from the other direction. It was very threatening because it happened with virtually no time difference. The weapon that fell from the sky collided with Gujel’s Dao. He thought it was an arrow, but its identity was surprisingly a spear. It was thrown, but it had great weight to it. The interlocked Gujel’s Dao made a sharp noise and Grid gritted his teeth. He hurriedly added his other hand to the hilt he was holding with one hand.
</p><p> [There are no attacks that you won’t recognize.]
</p><p> The transcendent senses overshadowed by his artificial senses were triggered. Movement came from behind him. Grid twisted his head fiercely. It wasn’t in order to fight back. Both of his hands were tied up by the spear that had fallen from the sky. Both feet were nailed to the ground due to the impact and the God Hands remained spread out in order to maintain the artificial senses. There was no time to respond, such as dropping a lump of Greed or summoning a pet.
</p><p> In a split second, Grid’s neck felt like it was squeezed by something. Grid’s view only contained the sky. Then a crater that was tens of meters in diameter formed around Grid, who was now stuck in the ground.
</p><p> Bang!Bang!Bang!
</p><p> Grid’s body was struck several more times. Every time, the area collapsed. The buildings of Titan, which only had traces remaining, burned to ashes and disappeared. After being bounced back by Gujel’s Dao, the spear that was spinning in the air suddenly twisted its trajectory. It was toward Grid’s defenseless heart. It shot forward like a ray of light.
</p><p> Kraugel, who had been running since it started, blocked it.
</p><p> “……?!” Kraugel collided with the spear and responded in the same manner as Grid. He quickly grabbed the hilt with both hands. The difference with Grid was that he couldn’t withstand the weight of the spear. Unlike Grid, who held himself in place, Kraugel was pushed back dozens of meters. He was overwhelmed in the strength fight.
</p><p> “Sigh.” One of Kraugel’s shoulders slumped down as he chose to step back and take a breath. Then the spear that was interlocked with the White Tiger Sword slipped and soared into the air.
</p><p> At that time, Grid flew far away. He barely stopped just before he was stuck in the city wall. He barely succeeded in getting rid of the touch that had reached out to him continuously.
</p><p> “……”
</p><p> An unidentified figure slowly rose into the sky, followed by the spear that had been blocked by Kraugel.
</p><p> Click.
</p><p> The existence who finally grabbed the spear—they were in the shape of a human being. However, there were wings on their back. The face was deeply shrouded, but it was due to the halo of light above their head. Everyone’s shocked gaze was nailed on them.
</p><p> A young angel with a spear larger than their height that was leaning at an angle on their shoulder. The name above the head of the teenager whose gender was hard to identify was very shocking.
</p><p> Raphael. The number one archangel. Two cherubs armed with small swords and shields circled around the individual and blew trumpets. It was a majestic performance as if to announce the march of the triumphant general.
</p><p> “Hello, Overgeared God Grid and all the human beings.” Raphael’s face was clear. There was no killing intent or enmity.
</p><p> ‘Did we get it wrong when we saw them throw Grid a while ago?’
</p><p> Such doubts could arise.
</p><p> “It is nice to meet you. It feels new to actually face the creatures created by the goddess. This is actually my first visit to the ground.”
</p><p> Raphael was unwilling to speak for a long time. After giving a bright and polite greeting, they immediately closed their mouth. They just looked at Grid with a smile.
</p><p> “What is your business?” Grid used Storm of the Fire God before responding to the conversation. He was frustrated that the cooldown of the red phoenix manifestation that he used on Gamigin was 12 hours.
</p><p> The 1st ranked Raphael, who mobilized the cherubs to form a trinity. The power that Grid momentarily experienced wasn’t comparable to Baal’s ego fragment. It was in a different dimension. In the two seconds of chaos, a third of his health flew away.
</p><p> ‘We can’t fight here. There is a high probability of annihilation.’
</p><p> First of all, Braham was vulnerable to angels. He might’ve regained his power as a direct descendant, but there were no combat skills outside of magic. It was right to consider him as having no combat power. Mercedes was also absent. She chased Barbatos into the Abyss. There was the knight summoning, but it wasn’t an option. The moment she returned, Barbatos’s sniping would become free.
</p><p> Out of those remaining, only Kraugel and Kyle could react to this speed. Among them, Kraugel was incomplete. First of all, he would be hampered by the stats difference. Based on the trajectory that was vaguely read with his super sensitivity, he would have to fight close up for predictions, but he would only be able to hold on for a while.
</p><p> ‘Besides, Kyle has lost his immortality.’
</p><p> It was impossible to rely on the souls of legends and heroes. The souls were freed after Gamigin’s death. They were literally in a state of pure soul, not soldiers devoted to the king. It was impossible for them to fight because they had lost their shape, becoming light that hovered around Grid.
</p><p> ‘Do I have to deal with Raphael with Kraugel?’

      </div></div><p> How long could they last? Could the others flee while they held on?
</p><p> The hopeful part was that Raphael’s descent wouldn’t last long. The status of the 1st archangel was too high. The world couldn’t afford it. In fact, Raphael revealed that it was their first time visiting the surface.
</p><p> The clear evidence was that the expressions of the cherubs, who were originally smiling like Raphael, were becoming stiff. Maybe they would go back by the time they were teary-eyed.
</p><p> As Grid made this guess, Ruby and the 10 meritorious retainers, such as Peak Sword, Chris, Huroi, and Yura, lined up on his left and right sides. They were fine compared to the other players who were caught up in the shockwaves that occurred after Raphael’s emergence and became ragged or died.
</p><p> Grid couldn’t help laughing.
</p><p> ‘They are trustworthy.’
</p><p> It was after the start of the great human and demon war. Grid grasped most of the combat that took place all over the continent. The battlefields that the Overgeared members didn’t participate in were only known through news while the battlefields where the Overgeared members participated were personally examined through videos sent by Lauel.
</p><p> At the same time, he felt the growth of his colleagues. In particular, the 10 meritorious retainers armed with items made by Grid was enough to raid the lower ranked great demons alone. It was a huge power. It was similar to Grid just a few years ago. It meant that no one could be the opponents of the 10 meritorious retainers unless they were the top beings of each region or species. Many of the 10 meritorious retainers even had a normal class.
</p><p> Grid had very high expectations for them. He didn’t want much. He wanted victory to ring even when he wasn’t present and he wanted to rely on them in situations like now. In a word, he wanted to feel comfortable. It was very harsh to bear the responsibility and maintain tension at every moment.
</p><p> “I visited to retrieve the souls of the legends. I’ve decided to ascend them to heaven.” Raphael revealed their business obediently.
</p><p> Tzudan’s soul responded.
</p><p> [Ascension! Tzudan is delighted that the hand of salvation has finally been found.]
</p><p> In Satisfy, Asgard was synonymous with heaven. Additionally, heaven had been the kingdom of the sky since ancient times. Originally, Asgard meant goodness. During their very long history, only the seven malignant saints perceived them as villains. There was no way to know exactly which era Tzudan was from, but for him, Asgard was heaven and angels were the savior. It was natural for him to be happy.
</p><p> Tzudan’s soul was slowly heading toward Raphael when he was blocked by Haksen’s soul.
</p><p> [Haksen is criticizing Tzudan. He is saying that Tzudan can’t read the atmosphere at all and is ridiculing Tzudan for having a monkey-level intelligence.]
</p><p> [Filewolf is nodding. He is arguing that they shouldn’t trust the opponent who suddenly attacked Grid that destroyed the great demon.]
</p><p> As expected of the giant and great magician. Haksen and Filewolf had a reasonable grasp of the situation. The startled soul of Tzudan was convinced and he hid behind Grid.
</p><p> Raphael didn’t care at all about the reaction of the souls. They still watched Grid while slowly extending a small hand. “Don’t be too vigilant. Asgard isn’t the enemy of you or humanity. Obediently devote the souls of the legends.”
</p><p> “Are you crazy?” Peak Sword opened his mouth in place of Grid, who was speechless from the absurdity. His eyes were wide as he pointed recklessly at the 1st ranked archangel. “Why are you saying that now after a surprise attack? You aren’t an enemy? Do you think we don’t know that Judar is behind the demons? This angel bastard! Don’t look down on a Korean’s ghost-like resourcefulness!”
</p><p> Raphael blinked their eyes. They seemed to be trying to understand Peak Sword’s words. Then they gave up and just got to the main point.
</p><p> “It is right that I sneak attacked Grid, but I don’t have any hostility. In order to save time, I wanted to subdue him first and then seize the souls.”
</p><p> “W-What? Isn’t this really crazy?”
</p><p> “I guess they didn’t receive a proper home education. I don’t think they have a home.”
</p><p> As Peak Sword poured out curse words, Huroi calmly analyzed it. His attitude was quite serious as he gave Raphael a sympathetic look and this made Raphael feel strange.
</p><p> “…I feel bad for some reason. I should go back soon. Now, Grid?” Raphael urged Grid.
</p><p> It was a strange sight to people. The spokesman of heaven was forcing a god of the surface to offer a tribute. It would be humiliating if Grid accepted the demand in this way. This was tantamount to the surface recognizing Asgard’s domination. That’s right. People recognized Grid as the representative of humanity. It was the same even for the dukes of the empire. It was a natural result, not something Grid wanted or intended.
</p><p> “Why do you want the souls?” Grid asked.
</p><p> He induced a conversation to buy time. Time was on the side of humanity. Raphael’s presence was fading in real time.
</p><p> “It is a question I don’t have the authority to answer.”
</p><p> “Is it true that Asgard isn’t the enemy of humanity?”
</p><p> “Of course. Isn’t your existence the proof? If humanity had been our enemy, you would’ve been extinct.”
</p><p> “Then why did Zeratul and Judar…”
</p><p> “That also isn’t something I can answer. “There is something called the divine right. Gods also have their private lives and this privacy deserves respect.”
</p><p> ‘The seven sins.’
</p><p> “So what about the souls?” The smile was gone from Raphael’s face. It was impossible for Raphael to not notice that they didn’t have time. They slowly lowered their gaze and a dark shadow was cast on their face again due to the halo of light tilting. It was bizarre because their face seemed missing.
</p><p> Meanwhile, Grid’s health had been completely restored. The conversation might’ve been short, but he benefited from maintaining Storm of the Fire God. He stretched his neck and spread out a wide area buff.

      </div></div></div><p> [Your undying willpower will influence your allies. All allies in the range of the storm are significantly less likely to gain an abnormal status. It lasts for up to 3 minutes and consumes an additional 5,000 mana per second during the duration. Cooldown Time: 3 hours.]
</p><p> [Every time your allies resist an abnormal status, you and your allies will gain a buff skill. However, it doesn’t stack with buff skills of the same type. The buff duration time depends on the type of buff.]
</p><p> He thought about it. There was no reason to shrink back even if it was a fight with a small chance of winning. There were many allies around him. Every player on the field, not just the Overgeared members, were hoping to fight with Grid. The responsibility that Grid had carried for a long time felt different. It felt warm and not heavy.
</p><p> ‘The 1st ranked archangel is trivial.’
</p><p> This was the surface. It was his sanctuary. In the first place, Grid pledged that he would one day go to heaven and rescue Hexetia. It was laughable to be scared of a single angel now when there were hundreds of thousands of angels to fight.
</p><p> “I can’t give what is mine to you.”
</p><p> Grid looked at Raphael and his fighting spirit rose like a flame. Gujel’s Dao roared as if responding to the sharp, murderous air.
</p><p> “I can’t communicate with you at all.”
</p><p> The atmosphere around Raphael sank heavily. Both eyes in the shadow shone coldly. Just then—
</p><p> Flash!
</p><p> Raphael’s halo grew rapidly in size and shone brilliantly. It was a light that could bleach all of the scenery white.
</p><p> [You have lost your eyesight. Resistance has failed.]
</p><p> It was a physical state that a legend’s resistance didn’t work against. Those who could resist it were extremely rare. Grid and Kyle with high transcendence, Kraugel with his sword light, Braham who responded with magic, and Yura with her high overall resistance…
</p><p> “……”
</p><p> Somehow, there were only six people, including Ruby, who looked calm alone.
</p><p> “……!!”
</p><p> People who had lost their vision shouted. Through communication, they attempted to overcome the darkness together. However, Raphael didn’t give them time. Raphael aimed at the battlefield by tilting the halo that shone and expanded its volume.
</p><p> “This…!”
</p><p> Braham felt the rapidly changing flow of magic power. Then the halo released a pillar of light. It was a pillar large enough to dominate the whole battlefield. This time, Kyle couldn’t escape the blindness. The physical states resisted by transcendence were based on probability and wasn’t complete.
</p><p> Kraugel was also blinded. The speed at which he slashed at the light couldn’t keep up with the speed of the rushing light. Braham’s magic was broken and Yura collapsed. It was because the particles of light caused a backflow in magic power. The existence of an angel itself was specialized in dispels.
</p><p> In the midst of the confusion and horror, Grid slashed at the pillar of light with the Falling Moon Sword. Raphael could be seen beyond the pillar that split in half. They had regained their smile. On the other hand, the cherubs on Raphael’s shoulders were about to cry. This sight gave Grid hope.
</p><p> Flash!
Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m</p><p> The sight of Raphael and the cherubs quickly disappeared again. It was due to the pillars of light that were created continuously. The pillars of light covering an area of tens of kilometers once again swallowed Grid’s vision. It felt like Piaro’s Pounding Mortar had been expanded by thousands of times. Unfortunately, there were several, not just one.
</p><p> “Keuk…!” Grid didn’t despair. He cut another pillar with 200,000 Army Crushing Sword. He endured the pain of his muscles being torn by the recoil and used Divinity.
</p><p> ‘One more time.’
</p><p> He used the crushing sword after the cooldown was reset.
</p><p> “It’s okay! I’m here!”
</p><p> The pain of Grid’s body grew bigger, but Ruby supported him. Heals and buffs were linked as she shouted hard to hide her tremors. Yes, he wasn’t alone. Once again, one more time, one more time, one more time. In just a few seconds, Grid fired the crushing sword to his limits.
</p><p> It was due to what the cherubs showed. He recalled that hope and consumed all of his Divinity. The result—
</p><p> “……”
</p><p> It was a complete defeat. There was a limit to Grid and Ruby’s skills while the halo of light was working nonstop. It continued to fire new pillars while still aiming at the battlefield. The non-legendary players would be wiped out. There was also a high probability that Kyle and the dukes of the empire would die. The worst thing was to have the souls taken away. In this case, he should put down his pride and consider fleeing…
</p><p> ‘…No, I can summon Sariel.’
</p><p> Currently, the number of angels present was three. If Sariel was added, then the trinity might be broken. It happened as Grid was accelerating his thinking in response to the falling pillars of light…
</p><p> Blue lightning danced wildly. It boasted a size and momentum incomparable to Kyle’s lightning and it resembled a dragon. It wasn’t a normal dragon, but a dragon of the east that was biting a yeouiju. The dozens of blue dragons broke through the pillars of light. They destroyed all the pillars and even hit the halo that was the light source beyond them. The formation of the pillars stopped along with a deafening explosion.
</p><p> People’s vision slowly recovered. In a world that lost the light, the first thing that people saw was Raphael’s stiff expression as they floated in the sky.
</p><p> “They are looking for a replacement for Michael.”
</p><p> The monologue of the man standing beside Grid caught people’s attention one step later.
</p><p> “It is really good that you didn’t give them the souls. I pay homage to you.”
</p><p> The hem of the silk dopo rose and fell in the storm. The moment this collar fluttered, a scar was revealed. Strangely, it didn’t look ugly. In combination with the man’s hazy eyes, it was reminiscent of a deep story.
</p><p> The pinnacle of all yangbans and the ultimate half-god, Mir—the existence made by the expelled gods to counter Raphael, he descended to the far western land. He was driven to destiny by his own will, not the command of the gods he served.</p>
