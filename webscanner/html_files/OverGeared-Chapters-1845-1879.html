    <h2>Chapter 1845</h2><div><p>“Is it a target that can be raided alone?”</p><p>This was a question that pierced to the core—the blue-eyed reporter made good use of the short time he was allowed to address Chairman Lim Cheolho.</p><p>“It can’t be done alone.”</p><p>It had been six hours since Baal’s expedition had entered hell.</p><p>Half a day had passed inside Satisfy. As morning turned to night, Grid and the Overgeared members fought non-stop. Even the concept of stamina, which had always held players back, seemed unable to dampen their enthusiasm.</p><p>“Then... in order for the expedition to succeed, the Overgeared members and apostles must join Grid, right?”</p><p>The Baal raid—due to the large-scale event that occurred by Grid’s will, the S.A Group suffered tremendously. Throughout this half a day, media companies around the world flooded them with requests for interviews. Obviously, the level of interest was very high. It was a far cry from the National Competition, which had been on a downward spiral since Grid stopped participating.</p><p>To put it bluntly, everyone in the world was watching the Baal raid and it disrupted their daily lives. At this time, it wasn’t very good for the S.A Group to remain silent. There was no reason for it. This was why Chairman Lim Cheolho held a large-scale press conference.</p><p>“It can’t be done even with many people.”</p><p>The crowd was agitated. The reporters writing articles in real time increased their typing speed.</p><p>“Can I say that it is like a dragon?”</p><p>In the past, Chairman Lim Cheolho had designated dragons as targets that couldn’t be hunted. Well, Grid had personally demonstrated that even if he couldn’t kill them, he could use them as a ride, but... in any case, a dragon’s majesty was still great. Was it the same with Baal?</p><p>Speculative articles were on the verge of pouring out in a matter of seconds.</p><p>Then Chairman Lim Cheolho shook his head. “It isn’t like a dragon.”</p><p>The dragons that Lim Cheolho was talking about were naturally the Old Dragons. It was because the Old Dragons were the true dragons.</p><p>“Baal is the ultimate goal for players. He is one of the final pieces of content.”</p><p>Just—</p><p>“But not in his current form.”</p><p>Baal used human fear as his source of strength. He couldn’t perish as long as people were afraid of him. He was impossible to raid in a different sense from dragons. It was necessary to achieve the prerequisites to make the impossible possible. It was to create an environment where people felt greater hope than their fear of Baal. It wasn’t something that a handful of players or groups could do.</p><p>Billions of players needed to interact deeply with Satisfy’s residents and built trust. A simple example was the relationship between Grid and Khan. The hope designed by Lim Cheolho was to sprout from the fact that the majority of players valued the residents of Satisfy and cherished Satisfy as much as reality.</p><p>The name Satisfy reflected Chairman Lim Cheolho’s wishes. Lim Cheolho wanted Satisfy to be beautiful, unlike reality. The great evil called Baal was a type of gateway to reaching such a world. It was the opportunity and key to uniting people with one heart and one mind. He wasn’t a being created for one individual to stab to death...</p><p>“Eh?”</p><p>It happened as Chairman Lim Cheolho was starting to explain...</p><p>A buzzing occurred among the reporters who stopped typing. They stared at Chairman Lim Cheolho in disbelief. No, to be precise, they were staring at the super-large screen behind where the chairman was sitting.</p><p>Chairman Lim Cheolho turned back and his face hardened. Baal revealed his original appearance. It was the last phase of the Baal raid. It meant that Baal was driven to the defensive in the ten minutes he took to move to this conference room.</p><p>“How...?”</p><p>It happened as Chairman Lim Cheolho was very flustered...</p><p>Kuaaack...</p><p>Baal let out a scream as his neck was slashed by Grid. It was an incredible sight. In this state, Baal’s defense increased by at least 20 times, but Grid alone dealt a significant blow...</p><p>Morpheus even added something shocking.</p><p>-Player Grid has broken the record for the highest damage dealt.</p><p>“......”</p><p>***</p><p>The shadow hovering over the horizon—they wondered how huge was that thing, seeing that it could be vaguely seen even from here...</p><p>The appearance of Baal, seen from a distance, stimulated human imagination to the limit. The apostles and members of the party were worried about Grid.</p><p>“Let’s go help,” Asuka urged.</p><p>She threw the hand axe pulled from a demon’s skull behind her back. Red feathers fluttered. The feathers that were originally white fell from wings that had turned red due to the blood of demons.</p><p>Kiyaaaaak!</p><p>Asuka wasn’t obsessed with a single weapon. She hadn’t even taken out the dragon weapon she had received from Grid during the angel appointment ceremony. She kept swinging and throwing new weapons she took from her inventory to slaughter demons.</p><p>All of them were Grid-made items. They were weapons that had been steadily strengthened every time Grid used Request to Stand With Me.</p><p>‘Where did she get all these crazy things...’</p><p>Ibellin clicked his tongue. He clearly realized that Asuka’s wealth and obsession were unmatched, and determined that he didn’t have to support her.</p><p>“Of course, we have to go.”</p><p>This wasn’t why he agreed. Even before Asuka could speak, Ibellin’s body had been turning in Grid’s direction. He acted like the captain of the angels protecting Grid. He intended to fly toward Grid the moment he shook off the demons around him.</p><p>The other angels felt the same way. Coke, Asuka, and the two people wearing silver and gold masks...</p><p>All of them were preparing to rush at Grid without anyone telling them.</p><p>‘Who are these people?’</p><p>He had good feelings for these dubious people. They were reliable, like colleagues who had been fighting together for a long time. In the first place, they were the ones Grid had appointed as angels. It was right to feel trust. However, it was inevitable to be wary.</p><p>He was reluctant to put his trust in people whose names and faces were hidden behind masks and who just silently carried out their duties. In any case, it was the time when the five Overgeared angels moved forward with one mind.</p><p>“Stop.” Someone put a stop to it.</p><p>It was Biban. The man who stood with his arms folded and yawned throughout the battle.</p><p>There were too many demonic creatures who tried to enter the underground area after hearing the screams of the red flesh... unlike the angels, who ran over and fought hard after hearing the report, he didn’t have a single drop of blood on his body.</p><p>“There isn’t anything you can do. You will only be killed like dogs, even if you arrive on time.”</p><p>“Shut up.”</p><p>Asuka let it spill out her other ear.</p><p>A member of the Tower of Wisdom—he was a Sword Saint and he had become the Sword God. She swore at him even though she had to know Biban’s reputation.</p><p>Ibellin and Coke were worried. Biban’s condition was strange to look at, with a broken sword hanging from his waist, but he wasn’t an opponent to be treated casually. It wasn’t that they were worried about Asuka being angry. The problem was that she didn’t respect Grid’s precious connections.</p><p>“I-Impertinent!”<nf589b> Sᴇaʀch* Thᴇ ɴ0velFɪre.nᴇt website on Gøøglᴇ to access chapters of nøvels early and in the highest quality.</nf589b></p><p>“What nonsense about impertinence?”</p><p>Asuka laughed at Coke, who had shouted at her, and finally flew up into the sky. It was a complete flight. This ability was gained thanks to the angel wings. She liked it very much. It was only now that the game seemed like a game. She hadn’t been able to shake off the peculiarity of Satisfy, which had seemed too real even though it wasn’t real.</p><p>“Rumor has it that you are an old man with dementia? Do we really need to listen to whatever you say? In the first place, we didn’t come all the way to hell to kill mobs, did we? Half of us can stand guard at the entrance here. I will go.”</p><p>“Uhh...”</p><p>Wasn’t it true that they came here to catch mobs? It happened as Ibellin was about to stop the excited Asuka...</p><p>Slap!</p><p>Before he knew it, Biban had stood in front of Asuka and slapped her in the face. Then an amazing thing happened.</p><p>Asuka, one of the strongest players, fell to the ground without even reacting. In the center of the large crater that had been created by her fall, she flinched as she was stuck upside down.</p><p>Was she dead...?</p><p>Ibellin and Coke couldn’t keep up with the situation and were stunned.</p><p>“Hahat! You want to fight, right?” Asuka shouted as she jumped up. She was much more energetic than before. It was because her berserker trait was activated. Her health had been decreased to a great extent because she had been slapped by Biban. If it wasn’t for the dragon armor, it probably would’ve been decreased to less than half. Finally, she pulled out the dragon weapon.</p><p>The angel with the silver mask, who had been silently watching the situation, prepared to step out. Then Biban appeared in front of Asuka again. He grabbed her by the collar and threw her in the direction of the newly approaching demon army.</p><p>“......”</p><p>An angel in the grip of madness—Asuka unexpectedly started slaughtering the army of demonic creatures and was much more brutal than Michael, who once appeared at the Rebecca Church’s Vatican. It was convincing why she was given the title of ‘Angel of Madness.’</p><p>“What a useful friend,” Biban said cheerfully with a benevolent smile. He didn’t seem like someone who half-killed a person and threw them into the middle of the enemy camp.</p><p>Biban warned the dumbfounded Ibellin, “Don’t be swayed by your subordinates on the battlefield.”</p><p>“...Yes.”</p><p>In fact, he wasn’t swayed at all. If Asuka hadn’t stepped in, Ibellin would’ve run in Grid’s direction right away. However, he hid this truth. He didn’t want to be treated the same as Asuka.</p><p>After his awkward answer, Biban spoke to him again, “Focus on the mission. The reason why Grid entrusted me and you with different missions is because it is for the best.”</p><p>They were words filled with strong trust. Ibellin was able to realize that the man in front of him had absolute trust in Grid. He thought that he wanted to learn from this person.</p><p>“Above all, right now...” Biban smiled at the vigorously nodding Ibellin and his eyes returned to the middle of the battlefield. It was the spot where Asuka was in full swing. To be precise, it was slightly above her.</p><p>A light was flashing in the sky in Biban’s vision.</p><p>Magic?</p><p>Ibellin was on guard, only to soon doubt his eyes. The light approaching at the speed of light. It was something’s arms, legs, and torso.</p><p>“We don’t have enough room to leave here.”</p><p>The underground area where Yura and her group was struggling—Biban blocked the entrance to it while drawing the Broken Sword. He was aware of it.</p><p>The fragments of Asura that had separated from Baal after he became a giant—they were trying to combine with the red flesh. He had a hunch that he shouldn’t let that happen.</p><p>***</p><p>It felt like running on a ridge that rose at right angles. The peak barely reached the end of his field of view...</p><p>This was Grid’s impression as he sped over Baal’s body, which was so big. It was a short thought. The ridge seemed to sway and his view rotated 360 degrees. It was the aftermath of the movement of Baal’s arm, which Grid was stepping on. Baal shook off the hand that had been gripping at Grid’s neck and waved his arms wildly. It was to remove Grid.</p><p>Bang! Bang! Baaang!</p><p>The explosion that occurred every time Baal swung his arms was deafening.</p><p>In the midst of the raging storm, the orange divinity that Grid wore around his body swayed like it was going to be extinguished. It became weak in an instant.</p><p>Grid held on with gritted teeth. He held the sword inserted into Baal’s skin like it was a pillar and hung down.</p><p>A shadow was cast over his body. It was the shadow created by the palm of Baal’s hand as it attacked him. He thought that the scenery that mosquitoes saw right before they died after sucking human blood must be similar to what he saw now.</p><p>A giant who would embrace and comfort the dead—after returning to his primal form, Baal overwhelmed Grid with his sheer size. However, the smaller being wasn’t overwhelmed.</p><p>If Grid was a mosquito, then there was a mote. It was Bunhelier, who was in the form of a black mouse. Baal’s enormous size gave him more freedom and he was already perched on Grid’s shoulder before he knew it.</p><p>“...Shouldn’t it be the other way around?”</p><p>Grid let out a laugh. It was a laugh of delight.</p><p>“Get on!”</p><p>Squeak squeak!</p><p>Bunhelier cried as he jumped off Grid’s shoulder. He grew his body at the same time, while Grid launched himself toward him.</p><p>Flash!</p><p>Bunhelier revealed his body. He was on the smaller side among the Old Dragons, and he had a rather small body compared to Baal, but he was big enough. Due to the free flight, Grid and Baal were at roughly the same eye level.</p><p>“Go!"</p><p>“Ohhhhhhh!!”</p><p>Bunhelier rushed in while releasing his magic power. Grid stood against the horn that rose taller than his head and released his full force.</p><p>It was a scene like two giant monsters colliding.</p><p>It felt like the genre had changed.</p><p>The epic depicted it magnificently. Humanity’s fear of Baal continued to fade.</p><p>Contrary to Chairman Lim Cheolho’s intention, a single human, called Grid, had taken root in the world. The name of the root was hope.</p><p class="box-notification fs-17">Sᴇarch the <b>Nʘvᴇl(F)ire.nᴇt</b> website on Gøøglᴇ to access chapters of nøvels early and in the highest quality.</p></div><h2>Chapter 1846</h2><div><p>The Breath contained Bunhelier’s magic power and shook Baal’s body.</p><p>“Ohhhhhhh!!”</p><p>Grid responded with Serve Dragon Pinnacle Wave Kill Link.</p><p>Jingle.</p><p>The sound of Chiyou’s bell was a precursor. Ultimate Martial Art was activated and caused Baal to reel again.</p><p>Bunhelier’s body slammed into Baal. Bunhelier, who had been holding his breath in the form of a mouse and succeeded in a surprise attack, had no intention of missing this opportunity. It was the same for Grid.</p><p>Giant Transformation—the transformation skill usually used by plant-type bosses had two clear advantages. The first was that their stats increased, and the second was that they didn’t get knocked down easily. Due to the increase in mass itself, they demonstrated a constitution that was immune to serious injuries. In particular, Baal had become so huge that he treated it as being stabbed by a toothpick even if he was pierced by a sword.</p><p>[Hurry! Pour it all out!]</p><p>Bunhelier’s will was conveyed to Grid. Perhaps it was because of the effect of Dragon Knight. Grid and Bunhelier communicated in real time. They read each other’s will as if it was their own and responded to each other.</p><p>Grid was already moving. God's Command and other abilities reset the cooldown of his skills, so he linked the six fusion sword dance again.</p><p>[The target has received 24,469,055,100 damage.] [1]</p><p>[You have broken the record for the highest damage dealt to a single being in the world!]</p><p>[Someone imprisoned in heaven’s prison has noticed your amazing achievement and is clicking his tongue.]</p><p>[”At this point, even Dominion and Judar will be taking notice...”]</p><p>Fortunately for Grid, Baal’s Giant Transformation only seemed to have half the advantages. It felt like his defense had become weaker. The damage was inflicted really well. Of course, it had to be taken into account that the combination of Defying the Natural Order and Twilight was creating a tremendous synergy. The additional damage effect against great demons meant the damage had tripled. Additionally, the weak point attacks and critical hits were the basics.</p><p>It naturally neutralized the strength of Giant Transformation.</p><p>‘Even taking that into account, the damage was dealt very well.’</p><p>What was the reason? Grid found it easy to guess. Originally, Baal’s strength lay in the chaining of the skills he learned from the dead. Thanks to these skills, he was able to deal more damage to Grid, while offsetting some of Grid’s attack power.</p><p>However, the giant form Baal didn’t use any special skills. Maybe it was hard to use human skills with that huge body?</p><p>Grid thought this and stopped the sword dances he had been linking without a break. This was because all the means to remove the cooldown of the sword dances had been exhausted. It was a pity that this wasn’t the Overgeared World.</p><p>He was in awe of Baal, who was still alive.</p><p>Kuaaaaaaaah!</p><p>The suspension of the six fusion sword dance also meant that the shackles of Ultimate Martial Art were lifted. Baal regained his freedom and roared like a monster in a movie. It wasn’t like he lost his sense of reason and behaved like a beast. He was just a bit excited from becoming huge.</p><p>Baal didn’t run amok. The first thing he did was to dispose of Bunhelier. He grabbed Bunhelier by the neck with his huge hand and immediately cast the curse magic.</p><p>“Groan...” Bunhelier was weak in hell. In terms of simply magic power and physical ability, he was halfway between the intermediate dragons and top dragons. It was very humiliating for Bunhelier, but what could he do? He was suffering the consequences of his own actions. He was paying for the sin of joining forces with a demon and harming his own kind. Nevertheless, from the perspective of Grid, there was a fortunate outcome.</p><p>“Let go!”</p><p>It was that Bunhelier’s status was completely preserved.</p><p>The status of an Old Dragon—it wasn’t a concept that could be dismissed recklessly. Just as Nevartan was still feared despite wandering in madness for hundreds of years, Bunhelier was still an Old Dragon. The fact that he fell into a demon’s trap and was tricked, or that he turned into a mouse to survive, didn’t undermine his value.</p><p>The effect of Dragon Knight was intact.</p><p>Grid fired an onslaught at Baal, who was about to rip Bunhelier’s head off. He deployed Request to Stand With Me and sniped at Baal’s huge hand. It was very powerful with the Dragon Knight effect.</p><p>Baal was unable to cope with the power and let go of his hand. Thanks to this, Bunhelier was able to breathe. However, a curse spell was falling from the sky.</p><p>“Again... I will come back again.”</p><p>Bunhelier didn’t wait for a reply from Grid. He immediately turned into a mouse and fled the scene. Thanks to this, the curse magic struck Grid, who was left alone in the air.</p><p>[You have suffered 1,333,333 damage.]</p><p>[The bondage of powerful magic oppresses you.]</p><p>[You have resisted.]</p><p>‘Damn.’</p><p>In a sudden turn of events, Grid was struck and he spontaneously let out a curse. In the first place, it was a bondage aimed at Bunhelier. He resisted, but the damage was quite painful. It was quite burdensome in a situation where he lost his health every time Baal swung an arm or roared, and it was like he received damage over time.</p><p>[Resent your judgment for cooperating with that guy.]</p><p>Could it be that he transformed into something smaller than a monster?</p><p>...Really?</p><p>Baal was momentarily taken aback by the sudden disappearance of Bunhelier before his eyes, only to smirk. He was quite satisfied with Grid’s bloody appearance. He was very relaxed for a guy who had suffered a lot of damage in a row and even showed ugly screams.</p><p>Grid belatedly noticed one thing.</p><p>‘Isn’t he going to die?’</p><p>Baal, in his humanoid form—he couldn’t last long against the merged Defying the Natural Order and Twilight, and suffered several deaths. However, the one who became a giant didn’t die despite suffering more damage than when he was a humanoid. It was even after being hit by the six fusion sword dance a whopping nine times in a row.</p><p>‘What happened?’</p><p>After becoming a giant, his health gauge itself had disappeared, so it was hard to grasp the situation. Well, it didn’t disappear, to be precise, but it was difficult to identify.</p><p>Baal’s head was located so high up. The health gauge that floated above it—it was physically impossible to discern the gauge at close range when it would be infinitely smaller than Baal’s head.</p><p>‘It is inconvenient in many ways because I can’t use Shunpo.’</p><p>Grid’s vision turned black as he clicked his tongue. It was because the magic power Baal released from his mouth attacked him.</p><p>A tidal wave seemed to be coming. The earth and sky were turbulent and further disturbed Grid’s view.</p><p>‘No.’</p><p>Grid was about to rally the God Hands to block it, but he changed his mind midway. He was conscious of Baal’s hand, which was chasing behind the tidal wave. He feared that he would be caught by Baal’s mighty hand and unable to move the moment he wrapped himself in the sun sphere made from the God Hands.</p><p>‘I have to find a way to kill him one more time.’</p><p>Grid thought while flying at full power and distancing himself from Baal. He wanted to level up...</p><p>It would become easier to fight if his stats increased. But...</p><p>“Keuk!”</p><p>The tide was turning rapidly.</p><p>Baal’s exhaled breath and every hand wave all put pressure on Grid.</p><p>Baal was a tricky opponent in many ways after he returned to his primal form. For one thing, it neutralized many of Grid’s strengths just because it was so huge.</p><p>The epic described such a situation. Grid was obviously in a crisis. It recorded it without turning a blind eye because it was a situation where Grid might die. What if it tried to hide it and Grid died? There was a concern that the epic would be treated as a distorted scripture, rather than one that contained only the truth.</p><p>All the records so far could be discredited, and Grid’s status could decline. However...</p><p>[Humanity’s fear has faded.]</p><p>People didn’t lose faith at Grid’s crisis. They weren’t frightened even after checking the contents of the epic that depicted Baal as a giant. They still trusted Grid. It was natural. Grid had shown them so many things. People gathered all over the world shouted that Grid would overcome even this new disaster. He would challenge again even if he failed without overcoming the crisis.</p><p>There was a being who responded to their beliefs.</p><p>“Gridddddd!”</p><p>It was Nefelina.</p><p>“Gasp! Gasp! Damn! This X-ing thing? What the hell is this? Why is it so big?”</p><p>Zibal’s curses echoed from the loudspeakers as he followed her on Raiders.</p><p>The entrance to Baal’s city where Jishuka and Zik’s party had been fighting—Nefelina and Zibal, who had been watching the battlefield from afar, rushed toward this place from the very beginning. Thanks to this, they were able to arrive in time.</p><p>“Nefelina!”</p><p>Grid suffered heavy damage again in the aftermath of blocking Baal’s fist and he used the recoil of the impact. He didn’t resist and flew obediently, quickly narrowing the distance to Nefelina.</p><p>[...Transcendent Dragon.]</p><p>Baal didn’t treat the daughter of the Insane Dragon as a mere hatchling. He was aware that she had inherited her father’s talents and could temporarily transcend her limits. Thus, he was wary of her.</p><p>A beam of black magic power was fired from his wide-open mouth. In the aftermath of his body becoming huge, the size of the light beam was also tremendously large. In terms of size, it was bigger than an Old Dragon’s Breath. It was a skill effect that could seem like the strongest skill ever.</p><p>Viewers thought it wouldn’t be strange if Grid and Nefelina perished side by side as they were swept up in it together.</p><p>It was a damn thing. They had been watching the show for hours and cheering eagerly, so they couldn’t believe that this was the result.</p><p>The 1st Great Demon, Baal—as expected of a final boss candidate, he was strong. It was clear that he was a mountain that couldn’t be climbed yet.</p><p>The moment everyone thought this—</p><p>“Kyak!” Nefelina screamed.</p><p>The huge, fast-moving beam of magic—it was inevitable and she didn’t avoid it. She was obliged to put the flying Grid on her back, so she flew with her back to the ray. Thus, a barrier of magic was raised. It was to stop the advance of the light ray for a while and to allow Grid to safely get on her back.</p><p>However, the barrier of magic collapsed in a disastrous manner. The structure of the defensive magic, which had been carefully designed by a master of magic, couldn’t withstand the ignorant strength of the powerful beam. She was going to be swept away. Even if she survived, she would fail to allow Grid to board her back.</p><p>It was the moment when Nefelina, overwhelmed by the rapidly approaching light, felt it…</p><p>A silver magic machine fell in front of her and blocked the ray. No, it was too horrible a sight to describe as blocking it. It broke and turned into ashes the moment it touched the light.</p><p>Zibal, who was riding on it, appeared. He looked determined even after losing a colleague who had been with him for a long time. He smiled as he used a skill with the dragon weapon he received from Grid and reduced the power of the beam, which was still powerful even after turning Raiders into ashes. It was the smile of a man who was an idol to American boys and girls.</p><p>“A hero doesn’t turn away from a child.”</p><p>Nefelina—it was the second time since she was born that she realized that the backs of people who were much smaller than herself could look so big.<nfb69c> S~ᴇaʀᴄh the ɴ0velFɪre.nᴇt website on Gøøglᴇ to access chapters of nøvels early and in the highest quality.</nfb69c></p><p>“Zibal...!” Nefelina’s cry didn’t reach him. Zibal’s hearing was completely ruined after being swallowed up by the remnants of the beam. He was just holding on with his dragon armor and struggling to fully handle the power of the beam of light. The beam was caught by Zibal’s skill and exploded without penetrating Zibal. Through the thick smoke that spread—</p><p>“I won’t forgive you!”</p><p>Nefelina showed up. Her wings were spread wide out as she charged toward Baal. It was a disappointing appearance. It was the limit of a hatchling. The not fully grown dragon was more than a dozen times smaller than Baal.</p><p>However, Grid was standing on her back. The god of the surface who scattered orange divinity from his body like a cloak or long hair—he was raising Nefelina’s presence to a great extent.</p><p>Still, Baal wasn’t shaken. The people also didn’t have any big hopes.</p><p>It was a little while ago. Grid rode on the back of an Old Dragon and couldn’t do anything against Baal. Being with a hatchling wouldn’t be enough for him to win...</p><p>Grid thought differently. “Transcended Linked Kill Wave Pinnacle.”</p><p>The five fusion sword dances.</p><p>Linked Kill Flower Pinnacle Drop.</p><p>Drop Dragon Pinnacle Kill Wave.</p><p>Revolve Dragon Drop Pinnacle Kill.</p><p>Linked Kill Revolve Pinnacle Chop.</p><p>They were the ultimate skills Grid had been using all along until he got the six fusion sword dances. It could be called his fundamentals. He killed far more enemies with the five fusion sword dances than the six fusion sword dances. It was the same for the four fusion sword dances, three fusion sword dances, and two fusion sword dances.</p><p>That’s right—in a situation where the six fusion sword dances were blocked, Grid returned to his roots.</p><p>‘It will be okay. It is going to work.’</p><p>Grid noted two facts. Baal hadn’t used any special skills since he became huge. Additionally, he took more damage every time he allowed Grid’s attack.</p><p>‘The Giant Transformation pays a huge price.’</p><p>Originally, Baal had honed his body to resist the power of the dragon weapons. Then after Baal became a giant, Grid broke his highest damage record several times despite Baal’s trained body. It could be interpreted that his body itself had changed again.</p><p>The energy of a God Killer, the Undefeated King’s Swordsmanship, etcetera—the fact that he didn’t use any of the skills he acquired also supported this. In other words...</p><p>[Kuaaack!]</p><p>The giant Baal lost even his immunity to the sword dances.</p><p>His primal form—he, too, had returned to his roots. From now on, it was a clash of the fundamentals against the fundamentals. There was an obvious difference.</p><p>Baal’s fundamentals was to wield his innate power.</p><p>Grid’s fundamentals was to utilize the skills he had honed.</p><p>It was because Grid was born as an ordinary guy with nothing. His fundamentals were polished by himself. Additionally, Nefelina’s small body worked to her advantage. She flew around and around between Baal’s legs, and Grid stabbed at his gaps.</p><p>Grid’s linked fusion sword dances easily slashed Baal’s legs. Baal’s body slowly started to tilt.</p><p>At this time, Grid noticed a new fact. The super fast regeneration—the fraudulent power that had restored Baal’s wounds almost immediately wasn’t working.</p><p>This wasn’t the aftermath of Giant Transformation. The super fast regeneration wasn’t a power taken from the dead, but Baal’s own power. However, it was weakened. It was a phenomenon that showed that the power of regeneration had been using people’s fear as a resource. Only this interpretation could explain why Baal’s recovery was so significantly slower.</p><p>‘Baal isn’t someone who can’t die.’</p><p>He was just in a position where he couldn’t die.

The wall that suddenly appeared like an illusion filled their vision. Then there was an earthquake and the wall was lifted.</p><p>Before they knew it, they witnessed the scenes of the demonic creatures on the battlefield turning to ash. Thousands of demonic creatures had been slaughtered. The fragments of Asura were also gone.</p><p>What happened? It took them quite some time to understand. The two people belatedly realized the truth and fixed their eyes on Biban’s broken sword.</p><p>“As expected. It isn’t cut.”</p><p>Biban aimed his sword at the sky again.</p><p>What they had doubted was actually true. The identity of the wall that blocked Ibellin and Coke’s vision—it was Biban’s sword that rapidly grew in size. It felt like the physical embodiment of the Space Sword, the Sword Saint’s ultimate skill that cut through the world with a sword.</p><p>The targeted fragments of Asura flew into the distance like a home run ball and the battlefield split in half. The demons and demonic creatures swept away by the shock either fell to the ground or fell off a cliff to their deaths.</p><p>“Hahat! Is the Sword God also overgeared?” Asuka giggled as she clung to the cliff that had just formed. She didn’t show any displeasure even though she almost died. Rather, she seemed to have formed a liking toward Biban.</p><p>‘She is an enigmatic person, even though I know her.’</p><p>It was true for most of the people gathered around Grid. It was the same for them.</p><p>Ibellin glanced at the masked angels who were observing before his eyes widened.</p><p>“Behind! Behind you!”</p><p>A slime-like flesh was creeping out of the underground entrance that the group had their backs to. It was very suspicious. He wondered if it was part of the red flesh that was fighting fiercely with Yura’s group underground.</p><p>The destructive power contained in Ibellin’s sword was enormous. The flesh was shattered with one blow.</p><p>Biban looked at the flesh scattering in all directions and cocked his head. “It is strange. I didn’t feel its presence. It is persistent.”</p><p>The group’s eyes shifted back to the sky. The fragments of Asura that flew away a while ago were returning. He felt a strong determination to enter the underground area.</p><p>“It is better to change the method.”</p><p>Biban put away Broken Sword. He stood blocking the entrance of the underground area and glared at the fragments of Asura approaching at the speed of light. The fragments of Asura that arrived were caught by Biban’s hands. Both arms were captured in the left hand and the lower body was in the right hand. Finally, the torso was caught under Biban’s armpit and it was immobilized.</p><p>It was a rather unrealistic sight. It was already abnormal that the fragmented body parts were flying around. Additionally, Asura’s arms and legs were twice as large as the average adult man, yet Biban held them with both hands. It was only possible because his hands were as big as pot lids.</p><p>Biban had veins bulging from his neck and forehead as he folded all of Asura’s joints. It was a fearsome strength.</p><p>He sat down and used as a cushion the fragments of Asura, which had strangely twisted arms and legs wrapped around the torso. Then he spoke to Ibellin, “Look for something to tie it up with.”</p><p>“...Yes!” Ibellin and Coke answered with a sudden sense of loyalty. They were thrilled after seeing what Biban had shown. Asuka followed the two of them silently. The angel in the gold mask also chased after the group.</p><p>Biban spoke to the man in the silver mask who was left behind, “Your eyes are fierce. Your uneasiness is showing despite the mask.”</p><p>“...Haha. It makes me excited that they don’t seem to recognize me at all.”</p><p>“You changed your race to an angel and even wore a mask. Isn’t it a problem if you are easily recognized?”</p><p>“I guess so...?”</p><p>It was during the time when the two of them were having a conversation.</p><p>“......”</p><p>The pieces of flesh that had just been shattered were moving slowly. They passed between the rocks and approached the fragments of Asura that Biban was sitting on. There were no signs. It was because it wasn’t a living thing.</p><p>Creak.</p><p>Only Asura reacted to the flesh. Asura desperately moved his arm, which was tied to his torso and bent in the opposite direction of his joints. He barely managed to stretch out one finger.</p><p>“Stay still.”</p><p>It was the moment when Biban felt a disturbance and put strength into his hips. However, Asura’s finger barely stretched out and touched the flesh. At the same time, a powerful explosion occurred. It was an explosion of energy. The origin was Asura, whom Biban had been sitting on. The explosion pushed away Biban and the angel in the silver mask.</p><p>“Cough, cough!” The angel hurriedly raised his head to examine the situation. He could see a figure slowly standing up through the thick smoke. It was a headless figure.</p><p>“This...!”</p><p>Asura’s arms, torso, and lower body were glued together.</p><p>The angel in the mask grasped the situation and took a battle stance, only for blood to spew from his mouth. Asura’s hand was piercing his torso.</p><p>“Hup!”</p><p>Biban’s cry rang in the angel’s ears as he was stunned by the shock. Before he knew it, Biban had come to his side and wielded Broken Sword.</p><p>Broken Sword was caught in Asura’s hand and stopped. It was useless. Asura was forced to let go the moment the sword grew in size. It slashed heavily and soared into the air. Biban supported the angel and went back to the entrance of the underground, guarding there.</p><p>“Did it combine...? So what are you going to do?”</p><p>An Absolute—it was a hierarchy that went beyond the concept of a nation or an era and controlled the fate of the world. There was no reason to shrink back just from facing a god.</p><p>“......”</p><p>The Evil God, Asura, who ingested the red flesh and took a form, was quiet. It was because it didn’t have a head. He didn’t even have nostrils or a mouth, so he couldn’t breathe. Only his heart was pounding.</p><p>Duguen, dugeun, dugeun...</p><p>The only sound was the heartbeat that got louder and louder.</p><p>“...Are you having fun?”</p><p>The Evil God derived from Baal’s desire and hard work—his madness irritated Ibellin and the others, who came running at the sound of the commotion. He was bizarre from his appearance and quickly spread fear.</p><p>“This is an opportunity to properly check his power.”</p><p>Instead, Biban laughed. He looked pleased to see Asura.</p><p>***</p><p>There was no invincibility.</p><p>Grid’s experience was telling him this truth.</p><p>From Elfin Stone, who was regarded as a disaster in the vampire cities, to Belial, the great demon who invaded the surface for the first time, the yangbans of the East Continent, the dukes of the empire, the archangels, Martial God Zeratul, and even the dragons.</p><p>Grid had met dozens of enemies he was ‘unlikely to win against.’ How were all of them now? They were dead, gone, or wouldn’t go against Grid. Grid believed that Baal would have the same fate.</p><p>A guy who had been playing with the concept of death at the peak of hell—he was a strong enemy, but Grid wasn’t inferior.</p><p>Grid’s individual force exceeded Baal’s and the firepower of the expedition led by Grid also overwhelmed the firepower of the demonic army called by Baal. It was thanks to the dragon weapons and armor that had been produced and enhanced in large quantities.</p><p>‘I will win.’</p><p>It was a conclusion based on thorough analysis, not vague confidence. Grid’s expedition this time must be successful. He was confident from the beginning and put it into action. It was beyond his calculations that Baal became stronger than expected, but this wasn’t even a variable. It was because Grid also grew stronger in real time.</p><p>[Die...!]</p><p>Baal slumped down and shouted in a threatening manner. No, it was more than just a threat. It was a real danger. He shot a ray of magic power every time he opened his mouth.</p><p>“Ugh...!” Nefelina swallowed down a scream as she turned and narrowly avoided the light. She didn’t know how many times this had already happened. If she was polymorphed as a human being, then she would have a half-crying face.</p><p>“I’m sorry, Nefelina!” Grid grabbed Nefelina’s horn to guide her flight path. He headed straight for the newly fired beam.</p><p>“Hiik!”</p><p>The flapping of Nefelina’s wings stopped for a moment. It was only for a moment. Her eyes snapped shut and she flapped her wings again. She risked turning into a rag and rushed in. It was because that was what Grid wanted.</p><p>It was a misunderstanding. Grid didn’t want to hurt Nefelina. He hoped to close the distance between them and Baal. He was responsible for Nefelina’s safety by striking the beam with Revolve the moment it was about to touch.</p><p>‘There are 20 seconds left.’</p><p>Nefelina was a hatchling. She had only temporarily transcended her limits. Originally, she didn’t have the qualifications to activate Dragon Knight. Additionally, the time of this transcendence was limited. He had to gain more benefits.</p><p>[Kuaaack...!]</p><p>Baal allowed Grid’s approach and screamed again. There was a mind-numbing pain. Baal thought that the sword Grid was wielding was really unreasonable. He keenly realized how miserable and painful the feelings of an innocent victim were.</p><p>That’s right.</p><p>Gourmet Dragon Raiders, Fire Dragon Trauka, Blacksmith God Hexetia, the Great Robber of the Red Night, Grid, and Khan—the power of Defying the Natural Order, created through the cooperation of many Absolutes and transcendents, made Baal understand the position of the weak.<nffb2a> S~ᴇaʀᴄh the N0ᴠᴇFɪre.nᴇt website on Gøøglᴇ to access chapters of nøvels early and in the highest quality.</nffb2a></p><p>It made Baal realize how cruel his crimes had been. Baal had no choice but to admit it.</p><p>‘He is stronger than me.’</p><p>The dragons—he didn’t expect for a monster to be born that could use the creatures even Rebecca couldn’t control as a power in a different way.</p><p>[Dragon...! Knight!]</p><p>Baal’s angry cries set off a series of explosions. It resembled Dragon Fear. It was a powerful technique created simply by combining his loud voice and magic power.</p><p>Nefelina’s small body shook like she was going to fall. Then she spun around and Grid missed his target. It gave Baal an opportunity to fight back.</p><p>[It is up to here...!]</p><p>Grid and Nefelina’s vision darkened. It was because the shadow made by Baal’s hand was getting closer. They would be crushed the moment they were caught.</p><p>Nefelina had a hunch, so she gritted her teeth and picked up the pace. However, she was slow. The short period of time where she was off balance proved fatal. Baal’s hot hand that was heated by mana touched her scales.</p><p>It was over...</p><p>Then the scenery that Nefelina saw changed like it was a lie. The valley formed by the ground that collapsed every time Baal walked disappeared completely and a wilderness spread out. Baal’s back could be seen in the distance.</p><p>Clack clack.</p><p>The sound of clacking teeth was heard.</p><p>An Overgeared Skeleton. The Overgeared Skeleton, summoned by Grid, changed Nefelina’s position.</p><p>Spatial distortion—it wasn’t like movement magic. This meant it was possible to resist to a certain extent the barrier blocking movement magic. It was thanks to Baal returning to his primal form. Most of the skills that Baal acquired from the dead were incapacitated.</p><p>“”I’m sorry... I couldn’t move you far. The amount of magic that Eve demanded...””</p><p>“No, this is well done.”</p><p>Hundreds of God Hands, each holding weapons, spread out like wings. They were like the wings of a spear. At the same time, Grid used Request to Stand With Me. He gathered the wishes of the people. He also activated Another Tomb, which had been used three times.</p><p>Finally, the six fusion sword dance was used. God's Command couldn't activate again due to the constraints of hell, but there was a limit to the restriction effect of the dimension. It couldn’t stop the cooldown from resetting.</p><p>A god who climbed onto the back of a dragon and spread wings like a spear blade—he danced in the rain of battle gear and magic. He slashed at the wrists of the giant evil who released inexhaustible magic power. He cut it, reached his heart, and inserted Defying the Natural Order.</p><p>It was a blow to bring down the sky of hell.</p><p>[Ah... Huuuuu...]</p><p>Baal groaned.</p><p>A being who had overcome death—he backed away with a flustered expression. He floundered as if he was frightened.</p><p>Finally, Baal collapsed and coughed up blood. The blood quickly formed lakes and rivers, soaking the barren land. Countless shades of gray were escaping from his body.</p><p class="box-notification fs-17">Sᴇarch the <b>NʘvᴇlFirᴇ.nᴇt</b> website on Gøøglᴇ to access chapters of nøvels early and in the highest quality.</p></div><h2>Chapter 1848</h2><div><p>Baal was different from the Absolutes of heaven. He couldn’t transcend the concept of time and was bound to it. It was because he became stronger as time passed.</p><p>Baal was aware that the current him wasn’t perfect. This wasn’t meant in a negative way. He was constantly evolving. He might not be perfect now, but he had the certainty that he could reach the peak one day. The more that jealousy and suspicion sprouted on the surface and the more that quarrels and wars were repeated, the more Baal was completed...</p><p>So there was always room for relaxation. It was to the extent that he accepted it easily even when he was first killed by Grid. He thought it would be different next time.<nfddbc> S~ᴇaʀᴄh the NʘvᴇlFɪre.ɴet website on Gøøglᴇ to access chapters of nøvels early and in the highest quality.</nfddbc></p><p>Then what about today’s outcome? Grid’s growth rate exceeded Baal’s predictions. This was even though his prediction accounted for Grid’s explosive growth. He even grew stronger in real time while fighting Baal. It seemed to have a superior advantage over Baal and made Baal’s strengths meaningless.</p><p>‘It is because the Old Dragons helped.’</p><p>Fire Dragon Trauka—everything went awry from the moment he gave an arm to Grid. A certain emotion started to boil deep in Baal’s heart as he analyzed the cause.</p><p>It was anger.</p><p>Wrath.</p><p>It was an emotion that was only felt by insignificant beings who couldn’t solve things as they wished. It didn’t suit the king of hell, who had ridiculed countless fates and manipulated them to his liking.</p><p>[...Kukuk.]</p><p>It was while being trampled on his chest and repeatedly cut by Grid—Baal realized that he had lost his composure from the start.</p><p>‘It was a defeat.’</p><p>The data of the dragon weapons and armor brought to him by his clones—ever since he was defeated by Grid’s swords and armor, which far exceeded their power, he grew impatient and this made him reach this point. Like an insignificant being...</p><p>He didn’t deserve to win.</p><p>The gray ash symbolizing death—Baal remained silent even as the souls he accumulated for a long time were escaping from his body. He didn’t bother trying to hold onto them. He didn’t even let out a single breath as he stared at Grid swinging his sword. Then he spoke words with difficulty.</p><p>[I can’t… if I am alone.]</p><p>“......?’</p><p>It was a situation where the duration of Nefelina’s Transcendent Dragon had passed. The Dragon Knight’s effect was lifted. Grid, who was alone, had become impatient.</p><p>At this time, Baal’s meaningful words were enough to make him feel uneasy. An unidentified noise was heard. It was like the sound of a clock’s hour hand moving. The problem was that it came all of a sudden. He felt something special that was similar to Chiyou’s bell.</p><p>It was a portent. The ultimate of an Absolute.</p><p>Grid noticed and let out his stopped breath. He soared into the air and flew far away from Baal. It was to control the distance, but it was a pointless act. The ultimate move of an Absolute couldn’t be bound by the concept of distance.</p><p>Flash!</p><p>The identity of the noise was revealed. A pocket watch floated between Baal on the ground and the flying Grid. It was a watch decorated with bizarre patterns. The indicated unit of time was also far from common sense. The hour hand spun furiously.</p><p>The surrounding landscape changed accordingly. The desolate wilderness of hell changed to a plain with lush vegetation and the green earth became scorching red dozens of times a second. It was an incomprehensible change from Grid’s position. It was the landscape of hell’s past, present, and future.</p><p>‘I didn’t know I would use this power.’</p><p>The underlying cause of Baal’s anger was fear. It was a fear that rose from the judgment that he couldn’t win against Grid. He felt like he was going to lose everything. It clearly meant that he was on the defensive. This made him regain his original appearance, but it wasn’t enough to reverse the situation.</p><p>Therefore, he relied on this will. The power of his father, Yatan.</p><p>I hope you will embrace those who died and fell here with that big body, relieving their sorrow by crossing time and space with this watch...</p><p>It was a power that was received along with this nonsense. Baal didn’t want to rely on this disgusting power.</p><p>One day, Yatan suddenly turned into a mess. He died a humble death like the weak, and Baal buried him in the Abyss with great difficulty. He had intended for Yatan to be forgotten in hell, apart from a few neutral areas where Yatan’s will still remained. Amoract established the irreversible religion called the Yatan Church, so those on the surface were clearly aware of Yatan. However, that was just a situation on the surface.</p><p>Baal hoped that Yatan would be forgotten in hell. Of course, a God of the Beginning wouldn’t perish just because he was forgotten. In order for Baal to rule and reign over hell, Yatan shouldn’t be allowed to surface. That power that had been suppressed—</p><p>[Grid, you brought this on yourself.]</p><p>He took it out.</p><p>The earth shook. It was due to the steps of a giant who appeared from the continuously changing landscape. A giant walked out from the green plain. His identity was Baal. To be precise, it was Baal of the past. He had an infinitely gentle expression compared to the present day Baal.</p><p>[The me in the past.]</p><p>Stagger.</p><p>A distorted smile spread across Baal’s face as he barely raised his large body.</p><p>[Along with the future me, he will slaughter you with me.]</p><p>The Baal of the future—it was his ultimate self that even Baal couldn’t fathom. It was the future him, who would’ve become extremely strong every time humanity experienced fights, wars, and destruction. He probably would’ve destroyed the Old Dragons on the surface and conquered heaven.</p><p>As he imagined it, Baal waited for his future self.</p><p>Grid’s eyes darkened rapidly as he noticed the situation.</p><p>The past, present, and future Baal had to be confronted at the same time? It was a ridiculous power. It felt like the victory he thought he had barely won was getting further away. The words defeat and failure were etched into Grid’s mind one after another.</p><p>“No...”</p><p>Nefelina was frustrated as she watched the situation from a distance.</p><p>Squeak squeak!</p><p>Bunhelier, who had been looking for an opportunity, also sat down. The mouse leaned against the wall and sighed as he slumped down.</p><p>“We can’t beat this. Squeak.”</p><p>Bunhelier had existed since the beginning of time. Even so, Baal’s power came as quite a shock to him. He was overwhelmed with a sense of helplessness after discovering that he had fallen into Baal’s trap.</p><p>What could Grid do? The preparations for the past few months and today’s fierce struggle had all been for naught...</p><p>Wouldn’t it be hard to stand back up again? Bunhelier thought that Grid would be finished like this. He thought it would make Grid give up on his vain dream of purifying hell and saving humanity.</p><p>The atmosphere became extremely gloomy.</p><p>“...It’s okay.” However, Grid didn’t collapse. There was no sign of despair on his face. The will in his eyes was too intense for him to pretend to be calm. “I’ve been through more trials than this. I can get over it.”</p><p>Originally, Grid was nothing. He was a substandard human being who only watched and envied people who studied and worked normally. Yet he had reached this point. No matter what type of despair he faced now, it was better than it was in the past.</p><p>[......?]</p><p>Baal found something strange. He showed signs of anxiety that went beyond the level of confusion. It wasn’t because he was intimidated by Grid’s unexpected attitude. It was because the future him didn’t respond.</p><p>[...This damn guy?!]</p><p>A scene popped into Baal’s mind. It was a scene of his future self sitting atop Rebecca’s throne and laughing at his present self with glee.</p><p>[...Two is enough.]</p><p>Baal gritted his teeth and glanced at his past self.</p><p>Grid, who was alone without any dragons—it was a signal to attack and kill this guy who had consumed many things throughout the battle and was weakened.</p><p>[......]</p><p>However, the past Baal didn’t cooperate. He looked at the present day Baal and took a step back. He disappeared into the landscape of vegetation. It was natural for him to not cooperate. The Baal of the past was still pure. It was a time when he accepted the obligations given to him by Yatan without questions.</p><p>Tick.</p><p>Finally, the pocket watch stopped. The landscape also returned to its original state.</p><p>“You betray even yourself.”</p><p>Grid approached and thrust his sword into Baal’s heart. It was the best blow of the day. All the movements of the six fusion sword dance were smoothly linked. It was a perfect embodiment of the ideals that Grid had envisioned. The weak point hits and critical hits were applied to all strikes.</p><p>[Kuek....! Kuaaaaaaack!!!]</p><p>Baal couldn’t contain it and let out a scream. It was a scream of suppressed emotions.</p><p>Death—he intuitively felt that the concept he had been playing with all his life was descending toward him.</p><p>‘Mistake... It was a mistake.’</p><p>Baal overcame death because he was the source of fear. In the beginning, Baal wasn’t an object of fear. It was all because he was afraid of Grid. In order to get rid of Grid without fail, Baal needed more strength and returned to his original form, only to be caught by this.</p><p>Now he couldn’t overcome death. Death really was the end. He couldn’t die.</p><p>Baal was more persistent than imagined. He proved the reason why he regained his original form by enduring without dying, even though he had already been hit several times by the six fusion sword dance. The fists he swung viciously and the rays of magic power that rained down every time he screamed turned Grid into rags.</p><p>This absolute defense and the Shock Mitigation effect of the Fire Dragon’s Armor couldn’t cope with the shock and it was gradually exceeding the limit.</p><p>‘Endure. Endure it.’</p><p>He was in the middle of enemy territory. There were variables such as Asura and Amoract remaining, so his immortality shouldn’t be consumed.</p><p>Grid was just as desperate as Baal. He was focused, not once blinking his eyes stained red with his and Baal’s blood. He was actively using his artificial senses and using his brain nonstop in order to somehow get hit less. This made Baal even more desperate.</p><p>Death—a concept that he had only vaguely imagined through indirect experience was right in front of him.</p><p>He was starting to realize death, extinction...</p><p>At this moment—</p><p>“My Liege...! Lord Baal! Croak!”</p><p>A bipedal toad came waddling toward him.</p><p>Chepardea, Baal’s closest subordinate—he was the most loyal one among the loyalists. He spat out sticky bodily fluids toward Grid, who was in the air. He stretched out his long tongue and tried to somehow grab onto Grid’s ankles.</p><p>‘This idiot...!’</p><p>Grid was on the verge of chaos due to Baal’s offense that struck in all directions. There were so many signals from his artificial senses that it was difficult to respond to all of them. It wasn’t an exaggeration to say that he was walking a tightrope.</p><p>The intrusion of an intruder at this time was a great headache.</p><p>Chepardea’s sticky fluids restricted the target’s movements and were judged by the God Hands as a real danger. They even communicated all the directions it was flying in to Grid, causing Grid’s brain to be on the verge of exploding. Eventually, a gap was exposed. It allowed Baal to fight back. The one who was afraid to die and was being attacked non-stop was given a chance to breathe.</p><p>“Lord Baal! I will buy you some time, so please leave this place...! You need to regain your initial form!” Chepardea shouted as he arrived before Baal.</p><p>Hundreds of times—no, the one who had been toyed with and killed by Baal tens of thousands of times was loyal to Baal without knowing the truth.</p><p>[Chepardea...]</p><p>Baal glimpsed hope thanks to this and he gave Chepardea a look of great affection.</p><p>Chepardea was thrilled. He was smaller than a speck of dust compared to Baal, but he stood with his arms outstretched as if to protect Baal.</p><p>“Only One God Grid...! I won’t let you take a single step forward!”</p><p>“You...” It was the moment when Grid was about to say something...</p><p>Baal’s large fingers formed claws, grabbed Chepardea’s chubby body, and lifted him up.</p><p>“Eh? Ehh?” Chepardea rose up and reached Baal’s face in an instant.</p><p>“My Liege...! Don’t worry about me! Get rid of me and run away...!” he shouted while flailing his short limbs.</p><p>He even had tears in his eyes. He was moved by Baal’s unwillingness to turn away from him in a moment of crisis.</p><p>Baal grinned at him.</p><p>[I laugh every time because of you.]</p><p>“...Haha? I-I’m glad...”</p><p>Chepardea’s face swelled like a balloon as he was responding without understanding what was going on. It was because Baal increased the strength of his fingers grabbing Chepardea’s belly. Chepardea’s face started to turn red from the unbearable pressure and this was starkly projected into Baal’s big eyes.</p><p>[Poor and foolish henchman of Yatan. I truly like you, who has been betrayed and killed tens of thousands of times, but still entertains me every time.]</p><p>“......!”</p><p>Tears of blood flowed from Chepardea’s swollen eyes just before they popped out. It wasn’t just the shock of his flesh and guts being crushed, but the aftermath of remembering the truth. It was a truth that always appeared when he was on the verge of death.</p><p>“...Yes... You...”</p><p>[This will be goodbye forever. It is too bad.]</p><p>Baal said goodbye and threw Chepardea into his mouth. From his perspective, he was chewing and gulping down something smaller than a grain of rice. It was to thoroughly digest Chepardea.</p><p>The demon who shared his soul, magic power, and body with the thousands of eggs he laid—he was powerful enough to proclaim to be Yatan’s guardian and Baal dreamed of evolving the moment they merged into one after ingesting him completely. He activated the spells hanging in the spawning grounds and all the eggs were transferred to Chepardea and digested at once.</p><p>[...Hah.]</p><p>Surprisingly, the signs of evolution didn’t come immediately. Still, it was enough to get through the immediate crisis. His wounds healed quickly. He had secured enough health and magic power to defeat the damn Grid and flee to the river of reincarnation.</p><p>[It was worth keeping that worthless guy by my side.]</p><p>“You disgusting bastard...”</p><p>Grid was no longer aware of the epics. He felt extreme disgust for Baal and let out insults.</p><p>It was something Baal was familiar with. He snorted and started to fly with his back toward Grid. It was toward the river of reincarnation. He was going to reach it in a flash.</p><p>...This was what he thought until a thunderous sound came from his stomach.</p><p>[What...]</p><p>The warrior who escorted Yatan when he left heaven—Baal’s worst mistake was to transfer over the eggs in order to fully absorb Chepardea’s power. Chepardea had unknowingly dispersed his magic power to thousands of eggs. At this moment, he embraced the eggs and regained his former power. He released magic power into Baal’s belly and shook all his organs. He was also being dissolved in gastric juices in real time, but he didn’t care.</p><p>[Sinner who terribly destroyed the shelter of those who lost their place after death, you will surely receive divine punishment today.]</p><p>[It has been a long time since your god disappeared...!]</p><p>Baal shouted to Chepardea, who was talking in his stomach. His voice cracked. He could barely feel the squeezing. There was a faint sense of joy that didn’t fit.</p><p>Pure evil. Even at this moment, Baal was delighted that he had informed Chepardea of the desperate news.</p><p>Surprisingly, Chepardea didn’t despair. Instead, he laughed. He said in a fading voice as he melted in Baal’s gastric juices.</p><p>[Don’t turn away from the god in front of you...]</p><p>He was referring to God Grid of the surface.</p><p>Baal came to his senses and looked back.</p><p>Grid stood on top of Bunhelier, who had reappeared like a rat, and yellow divinity was fluttering around him. It was the image of divine punishment that Chepardea had just talked about.</p><p>“Baaaaaaaaaal!”</p><p>[...You are like a cockroach...]</p><p>Baal’s will was insignificant. It was to the point where it wasn’t suitable to be called the source of all evil. It felt more suitable for Grid.

The castle itself was so huge that it was hard to guess the size of it, and while the number of rooms inside it were countless, all of them were empty. There was really nothing. There weren’t even any traces of life.</p><p>Maybe this place itself was a huge trap?</p><p>Katz even had such doubts, but he soon got rid of them.</p><p>A battle against patience—after wandering through the maze of corridors for more than half a day, he finally found it. Chains were strewn across the floor.</p><p>The chains—they took the form of a seal. It was created by Beriache’s technique and she originally targeted Baal.</p><p>‘It is around here.’</p><p>The chains were a signpost. Katz knew that Amoract was at the end of the chains and started walking after the chains. Nevertheless, he got lost several times. The chains were so long and entangled in all directions that they kept presenting him with forks in the road.</p><p>“......”</p><p>It was after a few hours of concentrating so much that he didn’t recognize the epic sentences that intermittently popped up. Katz finally reached the end.</p><p>The great hall lurking at the end of the maze. All the chains were pointing to this place.</p><p>Katz’ body turned to smoke as he slowly and cautiously approached the great hall. Beyond the huge door, he saw a woman bound against the wall. It was a woman with a white cloth wrapped all over her body. The outline of her body and face was more prominent due to the cloth, and she was as beautiful as a sculpture. There was the feeling that she shouldn’t be embraced.</p><p>The identity of the woman whose entire body was bound by thousands of chains. She was the 2nd Great Demon, Amoract.</p><p>He shouldn’t be misled by her appearance.</p><p>“......”</p><p>Katz watched Amoract while holding his breath. Grid had entrusted him with two missions. It was to spy on Amoract, and to search for Beriache’s soul.</p><p>Beriache’s soul was presumably currently believed to be in Amoract’s possession. If he encountered her, then there was a high probability he would be given a hidden quest. It was Grid and Lauel’s guess that this would be of great help to the expedition.</p><p>‘It is quiet.’</p><p>Katz watched Amoract’s reaction every time a new sentence of the epic popped up. There was no movement at all. She was silent no matter how the epics described Baal’s condition. It was the same when it stated that Grid was on the defensive. She remained silent even when the unbelievable sentence was written about the king of hell becoming fearful.</p><p>‘It doesn’t matter.’</p><p>The attitude of not caring about what the fate of hell was...</p><p>‘She really isn’t getting involved in this case...?’</p><p>It wasn’t just strange. Amoract had collaborated with Baal to banish Beriache from hell but that was the only time she collaborated with Baal. From the time hell was distorted to the present day, she walked a different path from Baal. Leraje and Eligos had testified to it. The Yatan Church was also evidence of it. Unlike Baal, who denied Yatan, Amoract even set up a religion using proxies and made humans worship Yatan.</p><p>‘It seems obvious that she is at odds with Baal like Grid says...’</p><p>Even so, it would be too much from Amoract’s perspective to stand by as Baal fell into a crisis. If Baal died, Grid’s next target would naturally be Amoract. Amoract couldn’t just stand by and watch Baal’s crisis for her own safety. Even if she didn’t openly help Baal, it was right for her to try and interfere with Grid, even indirectly.</p><p>So how long was she going to stay silent?</p><p>It happened as Katz’ doubts were growing...</p><p>[Baal and I are very compatible. It is obvious since our father made us as a pair from the beginning.]</p><p>Throughout the great hall—no, the woman’s voice rang throughout the castle.</p><p>“......?”</p><p>Katz didn’t notice for a moment that the owner of the voice was Amoract. It was because Amoract was chained up, just like when she first appeared. Her mouth didn’t move at all. However, she was talking.</p><p>It was intent.</p><p>[Every time I stir up a conflict and cause more strife, death comes like a tidal wave and Baal grows stronger. My activities benefit Baal so Baal didn’t harm me.]</p><p>Baal delighted in harming beings other than himself. However, he had ignored Amoract, who was opposing him. This was the moment when the reason was revealed.</p><p>In addition.</p><p>[That’s why I didn’t break this bondage.]<nfe8d5> Sᴇaʀᴄh the NʘvᴇlFɪre.ɴet website on Gøøglᴇ to access chapters of nøvels early and in the highest quality.</nfe8d5></p><p>One of the Evils of the Beginning—Amoract, one of the Absolutes of hell, just like Baal, had been too quiet. She only established the Yatan Church so that people could worship Yatan. She didn’t come to the surface and actively harm humans. She even stood by when the Yatan Church collapsed.</p><p>Was she favorable or indifferent to humans? It was an attitude that produced such hopeful observations. However, the truth was different. Amoract just didn’t want to help Baal.</p><p>[The 1st Great Demon, ‘Baal,’ has died.]</p><p>Just in time, a shocking message occurred. No way, it actually happened. Grid really defeated Baal. He succeeded in a solo raid.</p><p>It happened the moment when Katz was overcome with shivers...</p><p>Rattle.</p><p>Amoract raised her head. The chains extended to restrain her, but it was useless. As Amoract slowly stretched her waist and leaned back her upper body, all the chains that bound her started to loosen.</p><p>[Now there is no reason to be bound.]</p><p>Amoract was also a mutant. She wasn’t good, contrary to the wishes of the absolute god Yatan, who gave birth to children in order to comfort and protect the dead. It was just like Baal. Therefore, she cooperated with Baal and expelled Beriache. Putting aside her love for her father, she had helped Baal distort hell.</p><p>Pure evil—the moment she loosened her restraints and stepped on the cold marble floor...</p><p>“”We have to stop her.””</p><p>A buzzing voice permeated Katz’ ears. It was the voice of a soul. A soul in the form of a slender girl.</p><p>An Absolute being on the surface who controlled several dragons through force and helped Grid—it seemed to be a younger version of Marie Rose, the vampire duke who contributed greatly to the success of the Baal raid.</p><p>“Beriache...!”</p><p>Katz, who had been trying to stay calm even in an urgent situation, was a bit relieved. He saw an opportunity to break the stalemate.</p><p>[You have witnessed your master in a previous life.]</p><p>[The class ‘Beriache’s Warrior’ has awakened.]</p><p>[By designating Beriache as a loyal target, all your stats have temporarily increased.]</p><p>[The function of some skills has been changed and the cooldown time adjusted.]</p><p>Katz restored his body that had been in the form of smoke and forged a sword from his blood. His right hand was holding a dragon weapon made by Grid while his left hand held that blood sword that originated from Beriache’s power. He held the two swords and took the posture of ‘Protector of the Last Guardian of Hell.’</p><p>Originally, it was a skill called ‘Relentless Pursuit In Search of the Master.’ Increased defense, critical hit immunity, an increase in weapon power, an increase in attack speed, unconditional critical hits, an increase in critical hit damage, etc.</p><p>All types of buffs wrapped around Katz and made him more powerful than before.</p><p>The pool of blood beneath his feet was ready to respond to Katz’ will. The blood staining the air red also gradually grew thicker to disturb the enemy’s vision and senses. The ancient class, which already boasted a majesty that was in line with transcendence, had evolved to a higher level.</p><p>[Beriache, that child is much better than the trash you made yourself.]</p><p>“”It wasn’t trash. The name was Gabbeli.”</p><p>[It was a name that wasn’t worth remembering. On the other hand, I think I will remember this child’s name forever.]</p><p>The wall behind Amoract’s back was torn down. It was something that rendered the position of Katz, who was at the entrance of the great hall to guard it, meaningless.</p><p>Katz immediately rushed over. He rushed at Amoract, who was trying to escape through the collapsed wall.</p><p>[It was purely because of Baal that there are bound souls everywhere in hell. Now that Baal is dead, all the souls have regained their freedom. Child, I have no intention of hanging out with you in a situation where Beriache’s soul might help you.]</p><p>“I have no intention of letting you go.”</p><p>[Haha, I’m sure you are great but it is too presumptuous to say that. Grid is currently the only one in hell who can pressure me. Even Sword God Biban can’t do it.]</p><p>Amoract had been nervous when she first felt the presence of intruders. Between Only One God Grid and Biban, who was reborn as the Sword God—it was hard to gauge which of the two had the upper hand. They were both great.</p><p>However, now it was clear. In the process of fighting Baal, Grid had grown in real time and was clearly stronger than Biban. On the contrary, this had become more convenient.</p><p>Amoract’s power was to cause conflict. In particular, Amoract’s specialty was to make the weak rebel against the strong. The ugly emotions that lay beneath human beings. It was easy to stir up their jealousy and desire. Moreover, the garbage left by Baal happened to be holding Biban back.</p><p>Asura—did Baal say that he was an Evil God? It was so absurd that it made her laugh. Their father was the only god of hell.</p><p>Another being—</p><p>Moreover, a bug made by Baal shouldn’t dare to claim to be a god of hell.</p><p>Amoract opened the warp gate and disappeared in an instant. The law of making movement magic impossible had been weakened since Baal regained his original form, and then it was destroyed with Baal’s death.</p><p>“......”</p><p>Katz missed her because the spear of magic he released reached her just as she disappeared, but he didn’t hesitate. He watched closely as the spear of magic that pierced her body was scattered. Of course, the scattered magic lost its form and luster. But the blood remained. Katz was able to figure out the direction in which the remnants of magic power-filled blood were heading in order to return to their master.</p><p>There were only a handful of players who could do this, including Katz and Euphemina.</p><p>“Can you open the warp gate for me?” He was merely asking just in case. Katz was aware that Beriache was just a soul. She might not be able to use proper magic. This was why he already started running even as he asked.</p><p>Then a warp gate opened in his path.</p><p>“”It is easy.””</p><p>***</p><p>“Is this possible...?”</p><p>“Really...”</p><p>It was over. This time, it was really over.</p><p>Baal, who repeatedly stood up without dying no matter what Grid did. The king of hell, who seemed to reign as the source of all evil and the object of eternal immortality and fear. He was slashed by Grid and silenced. Then he turned to gray ash.</p><p>The breaking news in reality and the epic in Satisfy announced Baal’s death to the whole world.</p><p>“Waaahhhhhhhh!”</p><p>“Sob...! Sob sob sob!!”</p><p>There were shouts of joy in reality and rivers of tears in Satisfy.</p><p>Death wasn’t the end, but the beginning of eternal torment...</p><p>The people who knew this truth and lived a life of despair were saved.</p><p>Sleepless parents worried about the fate of their children, children searched for ways for their parents, who would leave ahead of them to rest, young couples didn’t want to have children because they didn’t want to pass on this hopeless fate, single people felt even more anxious because they were alone, etc.</p><p>At the end of the day, everyone in the world was saved thanks to Grid and they were moved to tears. The excitement was so great that they couldn’t even raise their voices. It was also so great that they couldn’t believe it. People believed in Grid and followed him, saying he was their only hope, but they never thought that their generation would get their faith repaid so soon. They were ashamed by their lack of faith.</p><p>It happened when people reaffirmed that this wasn’t a dream, but a reality, and started to feel guilty toward Grid...</p><p>[You have suffered, Only One God Grid.]</p><p>A snow white woman—a pure and saintly looking being draped in a white cloth descended behind Grid.</p><p>[I expected you to be tired right after your fight with Baal, but I didn’t expect you to show me your back so easily. I can’t miss this opportunity from my perspective, so I am going to put restrictions on you so you can’t recover.]</p><p>Her existence was evil, contrary to her appearance.</p><p>The 2nd Great Demon, Amoract—the moment she appeared in the world, she threatened Grid in a very calm tone. She was already chanting a spell.</p><p>As she enticed Biban here, she immediately completed the spell to put pressure on Grid and weaken him. The face wrapped in white cloth was clearly smiling.</p><p>Baal—he was a guy who couldn’t be beaten. Amoract was fond of Grid who just got rid of him. She couldn’t hide her joy at the thought of not missing the opportunity that Grid had created for her to reign as the ruler of hell.</p><p>She hadn’t figured things out. Grid became stronger than she imagined in his fight with Baal. To be precise, he grew rapidly thanks to the result of killing Baal. He wasn’t tired at all. Everything that had been consumed in the course of fighting Baal had fully recovered. No, it was an evolution beyond recovery.</p><p>He leveled up in increments of 100. This not only restored the player, but it also had the effect of awakening his stats.</p><p>“...Uh?” Amoract groaned. It was a groan that came directly from her mouth.</p><p>She panicked as Defying the Natural Order was thrust into her heart.</p><p>The 9th awakening—Grid had broken through level 900 in the process of delivering the final blow to Baal.</p><p>“...W-What... Cough!”</p><p>The 10th awakening—as the result of the complete annihilation of Baal, he reached level 1,000. This was the value of the king of hell. A second-rate being who pretended to be dead in the shadow of the king didn’t deserve to play with Grid.</p><p>[Stat redistribution.]</p><p>Grid distributed all his stats to agility when attacking Amoract and now he redistributed his stats in real time. It was the utilization of common player characteristics.</p><p>A player who reached level 1,000 could redistribute their stats whenever they wanted and there was no restriction on the number of times... this was the first time Grid found out about this fact. Additionally, the privilege of the first achievement meant there was no restriction on the cooldown time that occurred every time the stats were redistributed.</p><p>[You have invested all your points in strength.]</p><p>Amoract’s body was split in half. She couldn’t bear the power contained in Grid’s sword, even as a naturally born Absolute.</p><p>rainbowturtle's Thoughts</p><p>(3/4 weekly.)

Grid would’ve respected him a bit if he had shown a different side in his final moments. Apart from being the enemy of humanity, it was possible that he might forever be remembered as a worthy rival.</p><p>‘He was a stubborn bastard until the end.’</p><p>Grid erased Baal from his mind. Rather, he engraved Chepardea into the back of his mind.</p><p>The bipedal toad—looking back, it felt like he had encountered a lot of things. He wasn’t extremely strong, but his ability to spray mucus was tricky. He was annoying in many ways. It was to the point where Grid cursed him for constantly appearing without dying.</p><p>However, he wasn’t a being who should be cursed at. A warrior who was loyal to the God of the Beginning, Yatan. After Yatan disappeared, he was cursed by Baal to lose his memory and toyed with. Nevertheless, he didn’t break down even in his final moments. He made Baal his companion on the road to the underworld.</p><p>This was all Grid knew about Chepardea. From Grid’s perspective, he had no way of properly knowing the story of Chepardea, who was only a passing villain. The world would naturally forget him without remembering him. Therefore, Grid himself decided to remember Chepardea.</p><p>[The souls oppressed by Baal have started to be liberated.]</p><p>‘...Come to think of it, this is the underworld.’</p><p>The emotional Grid came to his senses. The sight of Baal’s severed and fallen body, scattered like mountain ranges in the wilderness, filled his vision. He was overwhelming even in death. He was so huge that the rate in which he turned to ash seemed slow.</p><p>There were countless gray pillars that rose from Baal’s corpse. All the pillars that started to disperse to various parts of hell were the souls of the dead. Perhaps most souls would be reincarnated as inhabitants of the neutral zones and enjoy comfort. They would forget their sorrow and pain of their previous lives, live peacefully, die, and one day be reborn on the surface.</p><p>‘Is the neutral zone a space created by Yatan himself...? It is amazing now that I think about it.’</p><p>The villages and cities in hell where even Baal could do nothing but watch—the places where the stone statues of Yatan were built were always peaceful no matter what hell was going through. No matter the external situation, absolute security was guaranteed.</p><p>Perhaps there was a name for it other than the neutral zone. However, the people of the present time had no way of knowing the name. They didn’t even need to know. In the future, the living wouldn’t be able to interact with hell, and the dead wouldn’t be able to ascend to the surface.</p><p>The situation up to now where the surface and hell invaded each other was abnormal. It was a deformity created by the distorted hell.</p><p>[You are the first player to reach level 1,000.]</p><p>‘Come to think of it, why...?’</p><p>The experience Baal left behind increased his level by a huge 100 at once. Despite this, Grid questioned it and wasn’t pleased. It was because the distortion of hell wasn’t resolved.</p><p>‘Ah.’</p><p>The mass of red flesh—the body of the hell moon, still floating in the sky, was the source of the distortion. Yes, killing Baal wasn’t the end. There was still work to be done.</p><p>[A player who has reached level 1,000 can freely redistribute the points in the four major stats: strength, stamina, intelligence, and agility. However, there will be a cooldown of three hours every time you redistribute the stats.]</p><p>[As a perk for the first achievement, the cooldown for the stats redistribution is removed.]</p><p>[You have earned the title ‘Guardian of the Balance’ as a reward for killing Baal.]</p><p>[You have earned the ‘Core That Has Existed Since the Beginning of Time’ as a reward for killing Baal.]</p><p>[Guardian of the Balance]</p><p>[A title given to the one who has saved the fate of hell, the surface, and all of humanity, which were being destroyed by the will of a great evil.</p><p>You are the only one who deserves to be the owner of this title.</p><p>Your existence balances the world.</p><p>No law or will dares to oppress you.]</p><p>An Only One title. The effect was tremendous.</p><p>[★ Ignore the unique effects of each dimension.</p><p>You would be affected by the unique effects of dimensional worlds.]</p><p>Simply put, it ignored Asgard’s penalty. It was proof that one existence, Grid, was greater than a world.</p><p>‘Seeing something like this... It is natural that Rebecca, the creator of the world itself, won’t be affected by the Overgeared World.’</p><p>Grid wasn’t in the least bit excited. He analyzed it calmly on the basis of the reality of strong authorities. He considered the worst case scenario and devised a way to respond. The experience of fighting the mighty enemy called Baal made him even more cautious.</p><p>However, Grid was also a human. He couldn’t always be composed.</p><p>[Core That Has Existed Since the Beginning of Time]</p><p>[Originally a possession of Yatan, it fell into Baal’s hands and contained infinite energy.</p><p>It can fulfill the user’s wish.</p><p>Yatan used its power to turn the power of ‘destruction’ into the power of ‘creation’ and created a shelter for the dead.</p><p>Baal distorted the shelter of the dead that Yatan created into hell.</p><p>Number of available uses: 1 time.]</p><p>“......?”</p><p>An object that could alter even the power of a God of the Beginning—there seemed to be no exaggeration in the phrase that it fulfilled wishes.</p><p>Grid’s eyes shook.</p><p>The first thing that came to mind was Khan and his son. He wanted to return Khan back to being a human being. He wanted to resurrect Khan’s son, who had died young and made Khan sad. That was where it started.</p><p>Grid thought that he wanted to take away all the pain and regrets of his precious people.</p><p>He wanted to go back in time before Asmophel fell into the clutches of the Yatan Servants and protect the lives and families of the Red Knights, including Piaro and Asmophel. He wanted to give Braham, who was abandoned by his mother after becoming obsessed with overcoming the Curse of Sloth and harming his own kin, a chance to think again. He wanted to help Kasim, whose clan had been annihilated by the empire...</p><p>“...Ah.” Grid came to his senses. He realized that there were few people around him who hadn’t been unhappy and he couldn’t undo their past. Everything would become twisted the moment he changed one thing.</p><p>For example, Kasim’s success in defending his clan meant he was able to fend off the invasion of the empire. At the same time, it meant that Piaro and the Red Knights, who had always been the vanguard of the empire, would suffer a defeat.</p><p>By altering Braham’s past, Braham could play a role that was completely antagonistic to Grid since he didn’t experience a human life.</p><p>‘In the first place, it is all over.’</p><p>They overcame the pain and got back on their feet. It was wrong for him to bring up their past. Additionally, not everything would be possible, even if this core granted his wishes. No matter whether he was an Absolute, the emperor, or the Guardian of the Balance, there were clear limits to a player’s authority. Grid had experienced it several times.</p><p>‘...Apart from all of that, it is only available for one use.’</p><p>Since it could only be used once, could it really grant any wish?</p><p>Grid suddenly had this thought and decided to stop paying attention to it. He thought there must be a separate use for this. It was close to conviction. It was based on the experience he had accumulated so far.</p><p>“……”</p><p>Then there were traces of magic power behind him. He could tell who it was without looking in person. Since the distance from the place where he felt the presence couldn’t be measured, it meant the space was distorted.</p><p>A warp gate had been opened.<nfbcca> Sᴇaʀᴄh the NovᴇlFɪre .ɴᴇt website on Gøøglᴇ to access chapters of nøvels early and in the highest quality.</nfbcca></p><p>[You have suffered, Only One God Grid.]</p><p>It was a memorable voice.</p><p>The 2nd Great Demon, Amoract—Grid thought it was just right.</p><p>‘All in on agility.’</p><p>He didn’t have to type any commands. The system immediately read Grid’s will and responded.</p><p>He stabbed his sword without hesitation at Amoract, who was constantly talking.</p><p>The Great Demon of Conflict—she was an unreliable existence from the beginning. He was going to kill her no matter what sweet proposals she made or what cooperation she offered. It was better to cut off the roots in advance.</p><p>‘All in on strength.’</p><p>Grid’s will became more concise and intuitive. His stats literally changed in real time and Amoract couldn’t react at all.</p><p>[The 2nd Great Demon, ‘Amoract,’ has died.]</p><p>[Your level has risen by 17.]</p><p>‘...Stop rising up.’</p><p>This damn thing. He had been telling people around him that the limit for players would be level 999, but he reached level 1,000. Then it kept going up? It was a bit embarrassing...</p><p>At this point, maybe Morpheus was deliberately modifying the system to be the opposite of his predictions? Grid still didn’t trust the S.A Group, who were suspicious, and distributed his stat points back to agility.</p><p>It was for high speed travel. The red flesh that Yura and Mir were currently containing was the target. There was no time for him to look at the loot. He couldn’t wait for Pagma’s soul, which hadn’t appeared yet.</p><p>‘There were so many souls that Baal had absorbed.’</p><p>Gray pillars rose from Baal’s corpse and embroidered the sky like stars. There were endless limits. He had to free Pagma’s soul in order to complete the class quest, but it seemed delayed since there were so many souls to be freed first.</p><p>‘It doesn’t mean much to finish my class quest now, but...’</p><p>For the current Grid, Pagma's Successor was just one of his origins. Even so, Grid wanted to obtain the rewards. It was important to finish everything.</p><p>Grid was about to use Shunpo, only to stop. It was because he detected the movement of new magic power in the sky. It was quite a powerful magic power.</p><p>‘Asura?’</p><p>The vigilant Grid paused. Then the identity of the figure who popped out of the fully open warp gate was soon revealed.</p><p>It was Katz. Nevertheless, he didn’t let down his guard. It was due to the girl that came right after Katz. To be precise, it was the soul in the form of a girl.</p><p>Beriache—she was one of the Three Evils of the Beginning, like Baal and Amoract, and she was the mother of the direct descendants, including Braham and Marie Rose. The moment she appeared, all the blood that had seeped into the ground started floating into the air. It felt like tens of thousands of red jewels were adorning the landscape.</p><p>It was beautiful.</p><p>“......!”</p><p>Grid’s eyes examined the situation for a moment before they widened. It was because the moment the blood that floated into the air and formed small droplets started to seep into Beriache, the presence of the dead Baal and Amoract were felt. He felt it from Beriache. It was a frightening phenomenon.</p><p>‘The power of 10,000 beings...!’</p><p>There were many types of strong existences. Among them, there was a type that became uncontrollably strong when ‘certain conditions were met’ and Beriache was that type. The ability to take the power of targets whose blood was sucked as her own. It was known that Baal even asked Amoract for cooperation because he couldn’t do anything alone against Beriache, who had accumulated power.</p><p>Yes, Grid was familiar with it. But seeing it in person was a completely different feeling.</p><p>Embracing the power of Baal and Amoract, who were already dead...</p><p>It was also only through the blood they shed as they died.</p><p>“”You don’t have to be vigilant. I don’t plan to go against you.””</p><p>It was a manner of speaking that didn’t match her outward appearance.</p><p>“Then why did you accumulate so much power?” Grid directly asked Beriache, who was more like Marie Rose’s daughter than her mother.</p><p>“”It is always good to have power. I have already experienced one failed life, so I think it is natural for me to always have a vigilant mindset. Rather...””</p><p>Beriache’s gaze shifted to Grid’s lower half. It was his groin area, to be precise. Beriache stared at Grid, who naturally closed his legs, before smiling.</p><p>“”I had wondered why you smelled like me. It is no wonder... your tastes are unique. I can see why Marie Rose hasn’t been able to conceive.””</p><p>There were small explosions everywhere. It was the sound of the God Hands destroying the cameras of the broadcasting stations.</p><p>rainbowturtle's Thoughts</p><p>(4/4 weekly.)

I was worried you might misunderstand, so after washing it thoroughly, I tailored it into a men’s style and used it...”</p><p>Beriache’s Underclothing—it was the strongest underwear in the world. Grid simply looked at the performance and used it. He swore he didn’t have any bad intentions. He felt it was unfair and sad that he had to give such an explanation.</p><p>“”You are kind. There is no need to go along with this unnecessary joke.””</p><p>Fortunately, Beriache didn’t seem to doubt Grid. It was a natural outcome from Grid’s perspective.</p><p>“I’m not in a position to joke around.’</p><p>Beriache—one of the Three Evils of the Beginning, and the sister of Baal and Amoract. There was only one reason why Grid was polite to Beriache. It was because she was the mother of Braham and Marie Rose. He respected Beriache for that reason alone.</p><p>However, that was it. It didn’t matter if she had gone against Baal in the past. Grid had experienced the evil of demons and he was wary of Beriache. He didn’t trust her. The fact that she tried to protect hell before it was distorted and that Yatan was a good being wasn’t enough to erase Grid’s vigilance.</p><p>“As you can see, the distortion of hell hasn’t been solved. It is a time when I need to search and eliminate the case as soon as possible. Therefore, I am wondering why you are holding me back with a useless joke. It is also right after you took Baal and Amoract’s power.”</p><p>He was ready to go out at any time.</p><p>Beriache read Grid’s thoughts and smiled bitterly.</p><p>“”You are the Blood King. It might not have been my intention, but you have inherited my will and you are the companion of my daughter. I just wanted to greet you and express my friendliness, but I was misunderstood due to my poor eloquence. I’m sorry. I lacked consideration.””</p><p>Beriache bowed deeply and apologized. She might treat Grid indifferently due to the self-proclaimed relationship between them, but she actually respected Grid from the bottom of her heart.</p><p>By this point, Grid had become embarrassed.</p><p>“......”</p><p>Come to think of it, wasn’t this his future mother-in-law? Grid’s heart became heavy at the thought that he treated her more harshly than necessary and he tried to find something to say.</p><p>“You are dodging the important answers. Grid isn’t pleased that you have taken Baal and Amoract’s powers. I think it is right for you to explain that.”</p><p>Katz, who had been quietly watching the situation, stepped forward.</p><p>A terrible guy—this was Grid’s first impression of Katz. It wasn’t just Grid who hated Katz. In the past, Katz was more arrogant and outspoken than anyone else, and he had many anti-fans around the world. A well-known American magazine had named Katz as one of the top 100 most hated people in the world. Maybe it was due to the experience of being sworn at too much, but Katz had the excellent ability to read the atmosphere. It meant he was incredibly tactful.</p><p>‘As expected... people who have experienced pain are different. The part where he thinks deeply and speaks clearly is a bit like me.’</p><p>The one person who had more antis than Katz was Grid—Grid felt a strange sense of kinship as he looked with satisfaction at Katz, who had grown up.</p><p>“”My warrior is loyal to the Blood King, not me...””</p><p>Beriache stated before shrugging.</p><p>“”Perhaps I am drunk because of the powers that have lost their masters. There is no need to ignore the power that I can obtain, right? It is just like how you took my underwear.””</p><p>Unlike Katz, who rushed to Grid as soon as he arrived at the scene, Beriache was still in the sky. In addition to spreading her magic power widely in real time, it seemed she intended to explore and absorb blood from the battlefield.</p><p>“”...Well, you might feel that this explanation is insufficient, so I’ll add something else.””</p><p>Grid belatedly realized that Beriache’s actions were very familiar.</p><p>The way she looked down on people—it was the habit of innately born Absolutes.</p><p>Hanul, Chiyou, King Sobyeol, Baal, Amoract, the Old Dragons, and Marie Rose—in retrospect, all of them did it.</p><p>If he had to pick one exception, it was Rebecca, the Goddess of Light. She had interacted with a handful of players in the past and always put herself in the players’ shoes. In order to not be a nuisance to players, only quests that fit the situation were issued in the form of ‘oracles’ asking for help. It was purely for the sake of the humans of the surface.</p><p>‘...Now that I see it, she is the most abnormal one.’</p><p>Thus, she was crazy. No, was she abnormal because she went crazy?</p><p>As Grid had new questions, Beriache’s explanation continued.</p><p>“”Our nature means we don’t perish. It isn’t that we are special. It is the law of the world. We are naturally bound by the law that the dead return to their souls and prepare for reincarnation.””</p><p>The ‘we’ she referred to was the Three Evils of the Beginning.</p><p>Grid remembered the moment when Baal and Amoract died. Both of them had been declared to be ‘extinguished.’ They didn’t get a chance for reincarnation and were erased from the world. Originally, even ordinary great demons couldn’t be extinguished without Ruby.</p><p>So how could Grid do it? He hadn’t questioned it. He thought they might’ve been punished by Yatan, so he just passed over it. It wasn’t that he skipped over it because it was annoying. It was a very reasonable guess.</p><p>Children who betrayed their father, a God of the Beginning—it was understandable no matter what happened to them. However, Beriache told him a different truth.</p><p>“”But Baal and Amoract were extinguished the moment they died and I think it was Baal’s arrangement.””</p><p>“...His arrangement. You mean? Baal did it himself?”</p><p>Grid frowned. Baal had planned his own destruction? It was hard to believe when looking back at the attitude of this bastard who struggled against his fear of death until the very end.</p><p>“”Of course, he wouldn’t have imagined that he would actually die. Considering Baal’s personality, it must’ve been half a joke. He simply thought ‘imagine the worst thing that will never happen and design the best solution.’””</p><p>The worst thing that will never happen. For Baal, it was death. Then today, he really died.</p><p>Grid’s epic detailed his end. It was widely known to the whole world. It was a fatal event for an Absolute. No matter what methods he used to try and resurrect himself, his status would suffer a terrible decline and he wouldn’t be able to reach his prime days.</p><p>For a being like Baal, resurrection was meaningless. Therefore, Baal designed the best solution. What was best for him?</p><p>Grid easily thought of it. “Asura... did he dedicate his death to Asura?”</p><p>“”I think so. It is because offering a god has a special meaning. It is also the children of a God of the Beginning being offered. Something beyond your imagination will happen.””</p><p>The Evil God that Baal longed for—he must’ve become stronger by now. It was the result of Baal’s death.</p><p>At this time—</p><p>There was a loud explosion in the distance. It was from the direction of the gates where Jishuka’s party was fighting. Could it be that the evil eyes’ king could no longer restrain Asura’s head?</p><p>Grid immediately used Shunpo. Beriache followed him.</p><p>Grid asked her, “If Amoract was also sacrificed, does it mean that she played along with Baal’s joke?”</p><p>“”That’s not it. Amoract’s opposition to Baal was sincere. She avoided interacting with him and there was no reason for her to go along with Baal’s will.””</p><p>“So you are saying that Baal forcefully produced this result?”</p><p>“Yes, it is possible that Baal chose the object to be sacrificed as ‘us’ rather than Baal himself. It means I am in danger as well. Asura didn’t exist when I died in the past and Baal wouldn’t have thought up sacrificing us. Now things have changed. If my soul is destroyed in its present state, I will also be offered up to Asura.”</p><p>“......”</p><p>Beriache’s soul must not be extinguished...</p><p>It happened the moment when Grid had a clear grasp of the situation...</p><p>Flash!</p><p>A foreign light flashed from the direction of the gate that was being covered by the evil eyes’ king’s destructive rays. It was a purple light. It was a pair of them. They were the light from a pair of eyes.</p><p>Grid immediately pulled out Defying the Natural Order. He intended to intercept Asura’s head, which was approaching.</p><p>“......!”</p><p>A chill went down Grid’s spine.</p><p>Asura—it was because the scarecrow, whose body had been torn to pieces and moved according to Baal’s will, showed emotions for the first time. There was a bright smile on his face as he got closer in an instant.</p><p>[Is there any reason for us to confront each other?]</p><p>He even talked. To be exact, it was conveyed through intent. However, it sounded like words because it embodied a voice with clear intentions.</p><p>[If you are going to block the way, then I will accompany you. But not here.]</p><p>Asura’s head, which was rapidly approaching, suddenly turned around. His speed didn’t slow down at all. Grid read his intention to meet and combine with his body that was somewhere else and chased after him with Shunpo.</p><p>However, it was as he said before. It was almost impossible to hunt down the ‘Absolute’ who decided to run away. It was because the other party could also use Shunpo. The moment Grid disappeared from view, Asura’s head became a dot as he also used Shunpo to increase the distance.</p><p>“”I don’t think there is time to look at the situation here.””<nfb939> Sᴇaʀch* Thᴇ NƟvelFɪre.ɴet website on Gøøglᴇ to access chapters of nøvels early and in the highest quality.</nfb939></p><p>Was the evil eyes’ king okay? There was no need to worry about the Overgeared members and Zik, who could be resurrected, but the evil eyes’ king had only one life.</p><p>After a moment of hesitation, someone shouted at Grid, who missed Asura’s head. “Porno is fine! Jishuka died instead!”</p><p>It was Vantner’s voice. Grid’s expression distorted. The name of the evil eyes’ king wasn’t Porno, but Pori something and Vantner was the tanker. It should’ve been Vantner who died instead of Jishuka.</p><p>Vantner clearly read Grid’s complaint and added, “I’m sorry! I mistook Porno for a shield for a second!”</p><p>“What...?”</p><p>He wondered what type of excuse this was, but he couldn’t help being convinced.</p><p>16 hours in length—during Grid’s fierce battle with Baal, Vantner held his shield in one hand and the evil eyes’ king in the other to tie up Asura’s head. Yes. He was holding the evil eyes’ king alongside his shield. Then Baal died and the tension was loosened. It was easy to be confused for a moment about whether it was the evil eyes’ king or the shield that he was holding in his hand.</p><p>Then he suddenly had to stop Asura’s head, which suddenly showed unprecedented power, so he held up the hand holding the evil eyes’ king, mistaking it for the hand holding the shield. It was fully understandable.</p><p>Honestly, Grid thought he might’ve done the same thing.</p><p>‘Damn.’</p><p>He hated himself for understanding Vantner’s position...</p><p>Grid lamented and immediately tracked down Asura’s head. He could feel Zik chasing after him but he couldn’t afford to wait. Asura’s head was so far away that he could barely be seen with Barbatos’ Vision. In any case, he was at least in sight. The function of Shunpo was to ‘move as far as he could see.’</p><p>[Then what if I do this?]</p><p>The wide distance was meaningless. Then Asura’s head smiled at Grid, who had chased him again, before scattering. The eyes, nose, mouth, ears, and even the strands of hair separated and spread in all directions. Each one used Shunpo. Among them, the ‘eyes’ stared at Grid for a moment. There was no effect.</p><p>[You need to ‘reach.’]</p><p>‘What is with this bastard?’</p><p>Was it because Asura kept talking?</p><p>Grid was stuck on the ‘mouth’ and chased after the mouth. That was the limit. The level of the God Hands, Randy, Noe, and the Overgeared Skeletons meant they couldn’t track Asura at all. Grid missed all the parts except for the mouth.</p><p>[Do you want to have a chat?]</p><p>The mouth was chattering.</p><p>[While you are tied up by my mouth, I will achieve my goal.]</p><p>“......!”</p><p>Grid stopped. He looked in the direction that was the complete opposite from this place. It was because he vaguely witnessed the scene of Biban’s sword growing to a scale that had never been seen before. Thanks to this, Grid grasped Asura’s location and turned around, while the mouth ended up chasing after him.</p><p>[Why didn’t Beriache follow you?]</p><p>It was while throwing out useless topics.</p><p>Grid ignored the babbling mouth. The scene of Biban’s enlarged sword being broken was projected into his black eyes.</p><p>[Pagma’s soul has been liberated.]</p><p>He couldn’t afford to pay attention to the new notification.</p><p>rainbowturtle's Thoughts</p><p>(1/4 weekly.)

Wasn’t it over?”&nbsp;</p><p>It was a very long and fierce battle. The battle of the hell expedition was so brutal that even those sitting comfortably in front of the TV to watch it were exhausted.&nbsp;</p><p>Could they really win? Baal was so strong that this question was repeated until the last moment.&nbsp;</p><p>People weren’t at ease for even a moment. In particular, the more they supported Grid, the more they suffered from anxiety. Finally, a number of people complained that their hearts were hurting.&nbsp;</p><p>It had been a while since then. It was barely finished. Baal’s death marked the victory of the expedition. As usual, it was a victory won by Grid.&nbsp;</p><p>People cheered in unison. Toasts were heard all over the world.&nbsp;</p><p>Now let’s take a break. Grid should take a break as well...&nbsp;</p><p>Just as people were sighing in relief that it was over and feeling a sense of exhaustion, something unexpected happened. An incident occurred. Suddenly, the broadcast was cut off and there was a new world message that said ‘A new Evil God, Asura, has been born.’ Of course, most people were logged out. However, breaking news poured in and spread the contents of the world message.&nbsp;</p><p>An Evil God. By all accounts, it was the beginning of a new ordeal. All the people who were already exhausted shook their heads. Most of all, they were worried about Grid.&nbsp;</p><p>A break—Grid must be the one most eager for it. However, he couldn’t get a break and got caught up in a new incident...&nbsp;</p><p>“It is right after he defeated Baal. It will be tough even if it is Grid.”&nbsp;</p><p>“I’m worried about the other Overgeared members. Hasn’t everyone been fighting demons the whole time Grid was fighting Baal? They have a different position from Grid, so they would’ve been exhausted from the start.”&nbsp;</p><p>The timing was so bad. Why was a new Evil God born at this time? There was a sense of blatant malice. It wasn’t through chance but necessity. In other words, there was a high probability that the situation was deliberately designed by someone. Of course, that someone was Baal.&nbsp;</p><p>“That sick bastard...”&nbsp;</p><p>The worst enemy was one that grabbed at their ankles, even in death. It was like Grid and the expedition team had stepped on shit.&nbsp;<nfaa8d> Sᴇaʀch* Thᴇ NʘvᴇlFire.nᴇt website on Gøøglᴇ to access chapters of nøvels early and in the highest quality.</nfaa8d></p><p>Something went wrong. Maybe they would lose a lot...&nbsp;</p><p>It was the moment when everyone was worried.&nbsp;</p><p>[Beriache might just be a soul body, but she has taken on the power of Baal and Amoract. She is currently one of the few beings in hell who can stand up to me, but she has disappeared. Even though she wouldn’t like to see a piece of stone claiming to be the god of hell in her father’s place.]&nbsp;</p><p>Purple lips that shone as if they had been painted thickly—Asura’s mouth continued to speak and irritated Grid’s nerves. It was an attitude that shook the concentration of the mentally exhausted Grid.&nbsp;</p><p>‘It isn’t a situation to care about Beriache right now.’&nbsp;</p><p>Come to think of it, why didn’t Beriache come after him?&nbsp;</p><p>Grid struggled to suppress the questions that naturally rose.&nbsp;</p><p>First, he considered her position. She said she couldn’t die. The moment her soul body was destroyed, Beriache would be reduced to the same state as Baal and Amoract. She would be sacrificed to Asura. That much had to be stopped.&nbsp;</p><p>The power of 10,000 beings. In theory, Beriache’s power had the greatest potential. There was a high probability that there would be no answer the moment the being in front of him, who had been reborn as an evil god according to Baal’s wishes, got his hands on Beriache.&nbsp;</p><p>[You are so wary of me. I am... if I had to make an analogy, I am like a newborn baby. I haven’t harmed anyone, let alone you. What is the point of being hostile to me like this? Why don’t you ignore me and just take a break?]&nbsp;</p><p>That’s right. Grid was strangely convinced by Asura’s words.&nbsp;</p><p>[The Sword God Biban that you are worried about is still safe. It was only a collision that happened because he got in my way. I don’t have any ill feelings towards him.]&nbsp;</p><p>“……”</p><p>Grid’s tension, which had remained tight since entering hell, loosened for a moment.&nbsp;</p><p>The words that Asura whispered made it that way.&nbsp;</p><p>[My purpose is to destroy the red flesh. It is the core that existed since the beginning of time that fulfills the wish of its user and is the culprit behind the distortion of hell created by Baal. The distortion of hell will be lifted the moment I destroy it. That is probably your wish as well. We should form the right relationship and work together.]&nbsp;</p><p>“......”</p><p>[Affinity with Asura has risen by 10.]&nbsp;</p><p>[It took a lot of hard work to knock down Baal. Leave the rest to me and rest well. However, don’t forget to be wary of Beriache.]&nbsp;</p><p>[Affinity with Asura has risen by 20.]&nbsp;</p><p>[Affinity with Beriache has decreased by 20.]&nbsp;</p><p>“......!”&nbsp;</p><p>Grid came to his senses as he continued to advance through a series of Shunpo. It was because he felt a sense of strangeness through the favorability system that worked arbitrarily even though he was silent.&nbsp;</p><p>“Is it Amoract’s power?”&nbsp;</p><p>The power to stir up conflict—coincidentally, it was a power that Grid had never experienced. This old fox hid in Baal’s shadows while looking for an opportunity and was killed by Grid after failing to make a proper move. It was a cause of being too cautious and being ruined.&nbsp;</p><p>[Hmm...? I was just being considerate of you.]&nbsp;</p><p>Asura’s mouth grinned. The body that was facing Biban must be scratching his chin calmly right now.&nbsp;</p><p>“He is worse than Baal, at least.&nbsp;Squeak squeak.”&nbsp;</p><p>The mouse perched on Grid’s shoulder spoke.&nbsp;</p><p>Evil Dragon Bunhelier—immediately after Baal’s defeat, he polymorphed again when he sensed the signs of Amoract opening the warp gate. Now the guy hiding in Grid’s cloak finally appeared.&nbsp;</p><p>“The worst evil has produced the worst evil. Indeed, it is troublesome in many ways if you are the strongest.&nbsp;Squeak.”&nbsp;</p><p>“...How long are you going to stay like this?”&nbsp;</p><p>“Baal might be dead, but the pressures of hell that bind me still persist.&nbsp;Squeak. There is no need to go out and attract anger in my vulnerable state, right?&nbsp;Squeak squeak...”&nbsp;</p><p>“......”</p><p>From Amoract to Beriache and then Asura. From Bunhelier’s point of view, they were all threatening existences. As he said, it was better if he stayed quiet than to attract attention.&nbsp;</p><p>‘The problem is that he looks like he is enjoying it.’&nbsp;</p><p>“By the way, he is a real monster. Even though his body is divided into pieces, his senses are shared and he seems able to use Shunpo freely. Even an Old Dragon can’t do such a thing.&nbsp;Squeak squeak.”&nbsp;</p><p>It was just a mouth, but it used Shunpo. Considering that the condition to use Shunpo was just to ‘secure vision,’ it was originally an impossible thing. As Bunhelier guessed, all of Asura’s body parts seemed to share a single sense.&nbsp;</p><p>“But I’m not convinced. Even if their senses are shared, their eyes are in a completely different place. In a situation where the eyes are looking at a completely different place from here, how can the mouth freely use Shunpo?”&nbsp;</p><p>“Maybe he has something like Barbatos’ Vision like you.&nbsp;Squeak. No, it must have a much wider field of view than Barbatos’ Vision.”&nbsp;</p><p>In the end, it all boiled down to one thing: Asura’s ability was extraordinary. It was an Evil God made by the offering of Baal, a child of one of the Gods of the Beginning, and the main culprit of distorting hell. It would’ve made no sense if he was ordinary, but this level was too high.&nbsp;</p><p>“You had better be determined.”&nbsp;</p><p>Bunhelier warned despite watching from the sidelines in real time how strong Grid had become.&nbsp;</p><p>‘It is a real plague.’&nbsp;</p><p>Grid frowned as he realized the seriousness of the situation thanks to this. It was right after defeating the biggest enemy. The desire to rest was weighing on him. No, in the first place. Should he be given time to recover after a big incident?&nbsp;</p><p>That was a cliche. No matter whether it was novels, a cartoon, a game, or a movie—it was a basic virtue that every story should uphold.&nbsp;</p><p>Grid even knocked down the source of all evil. He had just liberated souls and saved the twisted fate of the surface. What type of nonsense was it to be subjected to new trials one after another without being given time to rejoice?&nbsp;</p><p>The thing that worried him the most was that even at this moment, the apostles and his colleagues were fighting throughout hell. How flustered must they be to hear that a new Evil God was born as soon as Baal died, while the enemy in front of them was unharmed? His colleagues had been fighting with one mind and that was to hold on until they knocked down Baal. He was worried that they would suffer a state of collapse and experience a crisis.&nbsp;</p><p>“Those eyes... You are still worried about other people at this moment,” Bunhelier said with a sigh. “Pat...&nbsp;Squeak.”&nbsp;</p><p>It was pathetic.&nbsp;</p><p>Bunhelier was about to criticize Grid only to suddenly shut his mouth. It was the aftermath of remembering his battle with Baal.&nbsp;</p><p>A being he never would’ve taken down if he hadn’t cooperated with Grid—throughout the fight against him, Bunhelier had thought that Grid was strong. He had relied on Grid. Looking back on his feelings at that time, it wasn’t bad...&nbsp;</p><p>Doing things for others—if the result was ‘cooperation’ and his ‘purpose’ could be achieved as a result of the cooperation—&nbsp;</p><p>In the end, wasn’t it all good?&nbsp;</p><p>“...Can I also get a companion?”&nbsp;</p><p>Real companions who cared for each other and relied on each other. It was at a time when Bunhelier had a question he never imagined before.&nbsp;</p><p>“If you don’t betray me.”&nbsp;</p><p>Grid had been ignoring the mutterings of Bunhelier, who was on his shoulder, as he kept heading toward his destination. Now he suddenly opened his mouth.&nbsp;</p><p>“I will continue to be your colleague.”&nbsp;</p><p>Today, they were colleagues. They relied on each other so much that he thought it was a shame to end it as a one-off.&nbsp;</p><p>“...Kukuk.”&nbsp;</p><p>Bunhelier didn’t bother to answer. He just laughed like it was ridiculous and hid back inside Grid’s cloak. Immediately afterward, Grid landed on the ground. It was with his back to the angels.&nbsp;</p><p>“Grid!”&nbsp;</p><p>“You’re here...!”&nbsp;</p><p>Ibellin and Coke were enthusiastic. Asuka seemed to be secretly pleased. The expressions of the masked angels couldn’t be read. What they had in common was that they were blocking the entrance of the underground. They formed a barrier using their own bodies.&nbsp;</p><p>Asura’s mouth murmured after arriving just after him.&nbsp;</p><p>[Are we going to fight after all?]&nbsp;</p><p>Step.&nbsp;</p><p>Then the sound of footsteps was heard. The mouth, which had been floating alone, regained his body.&nbsp;</p><p>Evil God Asura—his complete appearance gave the impression of being ‘smooth.’ It felt like seeing a work of art with a purple sheen flowing over his sleek, muscular body. He was dragging something in his hand. It was BIban.&nbsp;</p><p>A giant person who was two meters tall—the Absolute, who had obtained the title of god in a human body, had been completely subdued.&nbsp;</p><p>[I didn’t mean to kill him from the beginning. I want to use this as an opportunity to erase the animosity you harbor toward me.]&nbsp;</p><p>Asura said while listening to the breathing of Biban, who was still alive. Then he released his grip on Biban’s hair and shrugged.&nbsp;</p><p>[Once again, my purpose is the culprit that is distorting hell. Your purpose is the same, right?]&nbsp;</p><p>The mass of red flesh—Asura insisted that he intended on destroying it.&nbsp;</p><p>Grid’s thoughts were different.&nbsp;</p><p>“You aren’t trying to destroy it, you want to eat it. That is who you are.”&nbsp;</p><p>By ingesting the source, he would become perfect...&nbsp;</p><p>Grid’s insight pinpointed Asura’s true intentions.&nbsp;</p><p>At this point, Asura couldn’t deny it.&nbsp;</p><p>[You saw it precisely, but... isn’t it also true that it will be destroyed if I ingest it? You will get the result you want. The distortion of hell will be lifted and the surface will have perfect peace.]&nbsp;</p><p>“That is until you cause a new crisis.”&nbsp;</p><p>Grid pulled out Defying the Natural Order and squeezed it.&nbsp;</p><p>He wanted some rest. For Grid, this was his only thought. He didn’t want to waste time having a meaningless conversation.&nbsp;</p><p>Then his face suddenly stiffened. It was because he felt something strange.&nbsp;</p><p>Sword God Biban—Grid had experienced his abilities directly and indirectly. Biban was a valuable presence that increased the power of the sword just by being by his side. But now it was silent. The sword energy of Defying the Natural Order wasn’t strengthened.&nbsp;</p><p>‘Is he dead?’&nbsp;</p><p>It happened the moment when Grid turned his attention to Biban, who was still lying on the ground...&nbsp;</p><p>Before he knew it, Asura was right in front of him and reached out. Dozens of hands rose like illusions behind his back, crushing and smashing the metal sun made by the God Hands and pulling Grid out of the sun.&nbsp;</p><p>Asura—he made dozens of movements with one hand gesture.&nbsp;</p><p>The angels witnessed this ridiculous ability in real time and were appalled.</p><p>“You are trapped.”&nbsp;</p><p>Unlike them, Grid’s expression didn’t change at all. He ignored Asura, who had grabbed him by the collar, and stared at the barrier that had been raised in the wilderness.&nbsp;</p><p>The identity of the barrier—it was Biban’s sword. The sword, which was broken in a ‘huge manner,’ formed a two-layered barrier on the battlefield.&nbsp;</p><p>Defying the Natural Order reacted to the feeling that was felt inside the barrier. It shook lightly and the sword energy was sharply amplified.&nbsp;</p><p>Biban’s figure, which had been lying dead, changed into a sword.&nbsp;</p><p>An ordinary long sword—it was one of the countless swords that floated in Biban’s mental world.&nbsp;</p><p>“The groundwork is almost done.”&nbsp;</p><p>The person who appeared above the barrier—it was Sword God Biban. He was holding Broken Sword in his hand. It wasn’t the ‘illusion’ of the broken dragon weapon that had grown huge. It was the real dragon weapon created in his mental world with Grid. It could never be broken.&nbsp;</p><p>“You can rest assured. Leave this place to me and do your work.”</p><p>A battlefield with huge swords forming a barrier. The hint was the sword in the background. This place was already a world of swords. It was Biban’s mental world. Without anyone noticing, Biban had taken over the space.&nbsp;</p><p>“I understand.”&nbsp;</p><p>Additionally, Grid didn’t doubt Biban’s skills. He immediately turned around and went underground. His goal was to destroy the red flesh. It was only then that the distortion of hell would be resolved and Asura, who lost his origin, would rapidly weaken.&nbsp;</p><p>[What is going on?]&nbsp;</p><p>Asura clicked his tongue and immediately chased after Grid. The angels blocked his way. However, it only bought him a split second of time. To be precise, they consumed a few movements. That was all.&nbsp;</p><p>It was enough. Biban arrived.&nbsp;</p><p>The sword energy, honed beyond the barrier built by the illusion of the sword, was contained in his sword. Asura and the angels felt it was the accumulation of power using the gap that had been created for a very short moment, but the truth was different.&nbsp;</p><p>Biban was the master of this world. He applied the flow of time differently only to himself and accumulated decades of sword energy. He only allowed himself to accumulate it. There wasn’t even a single speck of sword energy that was lost over the course of decades. It was because he was the Sword God.&nbsp;</p><p>"Thank you. Thanks to you, I learned the power of my sword, learned what I still lack, and was able to devote myself to learning.”&nbsp;</p><p>There was a small but eerie cutting sound as Asura’s smooth body was cut in two. The blood that gushed out like a fountain was blocked by the sword curtain. Biban’s figure looked like a gentleman holding a transparent umbrella on a day of blood rain.&nbsp;</p><p>“Grid, rest in peace.”&nbsp;</p><p>“...No... you are treating me like I am... dead....”&nbsp;</p><p>Asura stared blankly at the unrealistic scene unfolding before his eyes and scolded with a frown.</p><p class="box-notification fs-17">Sᴇarch the <b>NovᴇlFɪre .ɴᴇt</b> website on Gøøglᴇ to access chapters of nøvels early and in the highest quality.</p></div><h2>Chapter 1853</h2><div><p>The mass of red flesh—there was no other name for it. Their honest feeling was that they didn’t even want to mention it.&nbsp;</p><p>“Is it over? Really?”&nbsp;</p><p>The world message that emerged the moment Baal perished—Toban had been cheering at the thought that it was over, only to break out in a sweat. Not only was the red flesh unharmed by Baal’s disappearance, but the news of the birth of a new Evil God came right after. It was a desperate situation.&nbsp;</p><p>‘How long do I have to face this disgusting bastard?’&nbsp;</p><p>The red flesh formed a circular shape, but the surface was uneven. It was because it was wearing countless faces like an outer shell. The mouth, noses, and eyes of the dead were tightly embedded in the flesh and wriggled in real time. They seemed to be screaming together.&nbsp;</p><p>Please come and save me.&nbsp;</p><p>They seemed to be shouting to get them out of here.&nbsp;</p><p>Wriggle!&nbsp;</p><p>One of the human faces embedded in the red flesh seemed to protrude slightly. Finally, a human figure was vomited out. Once again, it was the yangban, Garam. He was killed by Mir a short time ago, but he was resurrected again, his body made from the flesh of the red flesh.&nbsp;</p><p>“It is very convenient that I don’t have to fear death.”</p><p>Garam smirked and rushed at Mir. Like his own body, he wielded a long sword made of flesh.&nbsp;</p><p>The sword flashed continuously like lightning. Dozens of blows were exchanged and Mir was pushed back a few steps. It was a shocking sight.&nbsp;</p><p>At first, Mir had easily overwhelmed Garam. He was hurt by the energy of the God Killer, but he easily handled Garam and the yangbans. However, Garam became stronger every time he was resurrected and he already reached the level of receiving Mir’s swordsmanship.&nbsp;</p><p>Garam was the only one. The other yangbans were killed by Mir’s sword no matter how many times they resurrected, while Garam became stronger in real time.&nbsp;</p><p>It was the pure difference in talent. Even after suffering the same death, Garam was the only one who immediately realized his defeat and quickly came up with a solution. He repeatedly studied and gained insight into how Mir’s swordsmanship incapacitated him and led him to death.&nbsp;</p><p>Before long, the red flesh didn’t resurrect the other yangbans. It only molded Garam using its own flesh. In the process, Garam’s arms and legs became a bit longer. His neck and ankles thickened, and calluses formed on his toes and fingers. The muscles of his entire body were reorganized in a different form than before.&nbsp;</p><p>It was the result of the red flesh responding whenever Garam realized and aspired for the physical conditions necessary to transcend Mir. Garam started to catch up with Mir’s swordsmanship using sheer talent and he was even blessed with an evolved body by the red flesh.&nbsp;</p><p>“The sword that destroys the gods.”&nbsp;</p><p>The energy of a God Killer—the incandescent long sword accepted the aura created from Garam’s intentions and caused a powerful explosion. It had the power to offset some of the absolute elements of Mir’s dragon weapon, One. Garam’s sword, which easily broke every time it collided with One, was intact for the first time. It endured dozens of blows and scattered pale energy.&nbsp;</p><p>Garam didn’t seem satisfied.&nbsp;</p><p>“It is still too much to say it will destroy a god. I’ll have to name it differently.”&nbsp;</p><p>The blue dopo fluttered and spread out like a curtain. It was a scene created by the shockwave that occurred when One pierced Garam’s chest.&nbsp;</p><p>“Cough... I should’ve dealt one more blow.”&nbsp;</p><p>A slight twist of the wrist.&nbsp;</p><p>Flop!&nbsp;</p><p>Garam’s body collapsed as he looked down with some surprise at One, which made it through his sword like his sword was a piece of paper. The beautiful body shriveled up in an instant and turned into dirty, red flesh.&nbsp;</p><p>A piece of flesh that was the size of a fist—it was the material that formed the body of a half-god.&nbsp;</p><p>The possibilities of the red flesh were limitless.&nbsp;</p><p>“At this time, I wonder if Baal is greater than Hanul.”&nbsp;</p><p>Step.&nbsp;</p><p>Garam walked out again. Once again, it was a body made from a small piece of flesh. It was newly made, so it was fine without any wounds.&nbsp;</p><p>“Unlike Hanul, who is limited to creating dozens of yangbans who are trash except for you and me, Baal’s creation can create and evolve an infinite number of objects using the material called the ‘soul.’ Isn’t that right?”&nbsp;</p><p>Chiyou’s test—Yangbans must study and develop on their own in order to qualify for the test and pass it. They had to try hard like they were human beings. It was too insignificant for a creature created by one of the Gods of the Beginning.&nbsp;</p><p>Therefore, Garam wasn’t satisfied with his life. He was jealous of the Absolutes who were perfect from the moment they were born and felt skeptical about his own situation. Of course, that changed after he met Grid.&nbsp;</p><p>In any case, the world felt easy and comfortable now. It was because his innate talent was in full bloom thanks to the red flesh.&nbsp;</p><p>“It feels so good... Mir, why don’t you get eaten by this too?”&nbsp;</p><p>“......”</p><p>Mir didn’t reply.&nbsp;</p><p>Garam—among the yangbans, he was one who neglected his studies and training.&nbsp;</p><p>Mir always regretted the waste of his talent, but that was a story from a long time ago. After discovering that Garam’s personality was very twisted, he was glad that Garam was lazy. To be honest, he would confess it now: he had been relieved when he heard that Garam died.&nbsp;</p><p>However, Garam came back alive in front of his eyes. It was while retaining his tremendous talent and terrifying sadism.&nbsp;</p><p>‘As long as we can’t destroy that red flesh—’&nbsp;</p><p>Wouldn’t monsters like Garam revive again and again and become the second or third Baal? He wondered if the source of fear that Grid had cut off would be resurrected someday.&nbsp;</p><p>Mir thought up to here and closed his eyes to control his breathing. He engraved a determination in his mind. That determination—&nbsp;</p><p>“Your prayer has changed. What are you going to teach me this time?”&nbsp;</p><p>“Don’t look forward to it.”&nbsp;</p><p>The method to suppress Garam’s talent was simple. Repeatedly killing him without giving him the chance to learn. For example.</p><p>“......?”&nbsp;</p><p>Killing him without him realizing it.&nbsp;</p><p>Flop!&nbsp;</p><p>It was only after Mir shook the blood from his sword that Garam collapsed and died like a broken doll.&nbsp;</p><p>Mir, the strongest yangban—until he met Grid, he had only one dream: to fulfill the aspirations of Martial God Chiyou and become the new Martial God. He worked hard in rain and snow to achieve that dream. It was while being grateful for his natural talent.&nbsp;</p><p>That’s right—Mir was superior to Garam in every way. Therefore, Hanul identified Mir as the opponent of Baal and Raphael. Garam borrowed the power of a demon and repeatedly evolved through expedient means, but he couldn’t surpass Mir’s hundreds of years of effort.&nbsp;</p><p>Grid also knew Mir’s value. Therefore, he made Mir his apostle without hesitation and gave him the most important role in this expedition.&nbsp;</p><p>The mass of red flesh—a monster who used the power of the souls absorbed through Baal, resurrecting them as demons and wielding them as its own limbs. It was very versatile. It was possible to easily counter specific targets.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, Mercedes. She could analyze the powers of the dead to counter and neutralize them, but it consumed a lot of mental power. As she countered the powers of the dead unleashed by the red flesh, she would become increasingly vulnerable over time as she received pincer attacks from the dead who were resurrected as demons.&nbsp;</p><p>No matter how strong Braham was, he was a magician and was vulnerable to close combat. Meanwhile, Zik had a weakness that his combat power rapidly declined the moment he couldn’t use runes. In other words, they could be attacked somehow if the red flesh made full use of the power of the dead.&nbsp;</p><p>Based on Grid and Lauel’s discussion, the apostle with the highest win rate against the red flesh was undoubtedly Mir. A being who mastered martial arts in the process of dreaming about becoming the Martial God and who freely handled the power of the Four Auspicious Beasts—Mir had an appropriate level of tolerance for all forms of attack.&nbsp;</p><p>He might not be as good as Mercedes, but he had the insight to grasp the weaknesses of the target. He could momentarily display a similar firepower to Braham and could be as versatile as Zik. Of course, expectations were somewhat low compared to Braham’s potential to ‘kill’ the red flesh, but Mir had the highest chance of buying a ‘stable’ amount of time for Yura to find a way to attack the red flesh.&nbsp;</p><p>The red flesh must be a living being. It was clearly wary of the fact that Garam had died without being able to react and drew out more of the power of the dead. It intensively passed on the pain, sadness, and despair of the souls it carried to Mir. It was in the form of magic, skills, physical powers, curses, and plagues.<nf7eb3> Sᴇaʀᴄh the Nʘvᴇl(F)ire.nᴇt website on Gøøglᴇ to access chapters of nøvels early and in the highest quality.</nf7eb3></p><p>Mir endured with the power of the White Tiger, the Black Tortoise, and the Red Phoenix.&nbsp;</p><p>He manipulated the ground with the power of the White Tiger to ward off physical attacks, he offset the curses and plagues with the Black Tortoise’s poison and curses, and he quickly healed the wounds inflicted by magic that he was forced to allow with the power of the Red Phoenix.&nbsp;</p><p>“Weren’t the Four Gods liberated by Grid?”&nbsp;</p><p>Garam witnessed the vision of the Four Auspicious Beasts rising behind Mir and frowned. In the past, when Garam was alive, the reason why they could use the power of the Four Auspicious Beasts was because the Four Auspicious Beasts were sealed and weakened. It was a power that could be taken away at any time the moment the Four Auspicious Beasts regained their free will.&nbsp;</p><p>However, Mir was using it and it was also all the powers of the Four Auspicious Beasts.</p><p>“...Did you become acquainted with the Four Auspicious Beasts thanks to Grid and retained your strength?&nbsp;Kukuk, don’t you have any pride? It is disgusting to see you cling to Grid, who is just a mere human being, just to be able to gain a bit more.”&nbsp;</p><p>Garam took a completely different posture than before. At the same time, the way he used Formless Will changed. He wrapped it around his body rather than using it to strike at and disturb Mir. It was different from self-defense. Rather than spreading it out widely, it was condensed and overlapped on a specific area. It was under his feet.&nbsp;</p><p>At the same time, the condensed formless energy exploded and he gained tremendous acceleration. He was conscious of the current that still remained weakly in Mir’s sword. Garam noticed that he had just been killed by Mir, who used the ‘power of the Blue Dragon.’ He did everything in his power to move faster than that.&nbsp;</p><p>It was useless. It was because what Garam could do, Mir could also do. Mir raised the energy of the Blue Dragon and exploded the intangible energy condensed below his elbow, while fending off the offensive of the red flesh. He bent his wrist to match it and the sword soared at a tremendous speed.&nbsp;</p><p>“This bastard...”&nbsp;</p><p>Did he see and follow along?&nbsp;</p><p>Garam realized what Mir had done and started swearing. His position was once again next to the red flesh.&nbsp;</p><p>“......?”&nbsp;</p><p>Garam’s expression was puzzled for a moment before he slowly stiffened. He realized that he had died without his knowledge.&nbsp;</p><p>“Huh?&nbsp;Is there a XXing case like this?”&nbsp;</p><p>A guy who grew one step faster than him growing stronger. It was the second time.&nbsp;</p><p>Garam smiled as the image of Grid overlapped with Mir. It was an expression he made when his anger was soaring to the top of his head.&nbsp;</p><p>“I have to kill you first before even being qualified to challenge Grid.”&nbsp;</p><p>His tone subsided. It seemed like he was trying to concentrate. Garam was thinking about how to attack Mir, who showed no gaps, only to completely shut his mouth and collapse. It was the aftermath of the bones and flesh of his lower body being crushed.&nbsp;</p><p>“What?”&nbsp;</p><p>Garam, who didn’t care how many times he died, was quite shaken. It was because the human faces covering the surface of the huge red flesh started to squirm wildly. Then the flesh started to swell up.&nbsp;</p><p>A spot on the flesh exploded. It was by Yura’s bullets. It was a bullet that accumulated the power of the dead, whose red flesh had erupted throughout the battle. The shooting method was also different from usual.&nbsp;</p><p>Faker shoved the bullet directly into the flesh’s body. After being shot several times by Yura, he identified a gap in the flesh with an immune system that was wary of Yura and targeted it accurately.&nbsp;</p><p>“You guys...”&nbsp;</p><p>Garam noticed the situation. The method to attack the lump of red flesh that easily regenerated no matter how many times it was cut and smashed—it was to inject ‘excessive energy’ at once to exceed the allowed amount and cause self-destruction.&nbsp;</p><p>In fact, the red flesh was collapsing. From the perspective of the flesh, which had been originally slowly absorbing powers and souls through Baal, it was a strange and dangerous experience to receive back all the energy that it had released at once. It was also great that Yura, Faker, Mir and Leraje attacked in the gaps created every time it took off some flesh to create another being and the accumulated wounds weren’t completely repaired.&nbsp;</p><p>The screams of the flesh as it crumbled like water-soaked mud continued for a long time. Garam’s body, created by it, was also affected and collapsed even more miserably.&nbsp;</p><p>“He is definitely running here right now.”&nbsp;</p><p>Grid—he must have no intention of resting even after he killed Baal. Yura knew he would be working to help his colleagues. This was the reason why.&nbsp;</p><p>“We have to finish it before he arrives. We need to give him a break,” Yura encouraged the group.&nbsp;</p><p>The effect was great.&nbsp;</p><p>Faker, Toban, Mir, and Leraje nodded and struggled to jump on the flow that she had changed. They tore down the red flesh. Soon—&nbsp;</p><p>“Yura!”&nbsp;</p><p>It happened as Grid arrived at the scene...&nbsp;</p><p>[The distortion of hell is released.]&nbsp;</p><p>The situation was over. The terrible screams of the dying red flesh shook the underground area and scattered the souls that it had accumulated like Baal.&nbsp;</p><p>At the same time, in front of the elevator heading for the surface...&nbsp;</p><p>“Mother...” Braham greeted Beriache. He looked sadder than ever.&nbsp;</p><p>“I didn’t want you to come here alone.”&nbsp;</p><p>Braham’s magic power was infested with divinity. It was an obvious divine force.&nbsp;</p><p>Beriache laughed bitterly. “Looking at you, I shouldn’t have given birth to Marie Rose.”&nbsp;</p><p>Then things wouldn’t have been so messy.&nbsp;</p><p>Beriache was holding a long, dark sword in his hand. It was the demon sword made from Baal’s magic power, which she had completely absorbed.&nbsp;</p><p>“I’m relieved. You are trying to protect your little sister.”&nbsp;</p><p>That isn’t it.&nbsp;I’m just trying to keep Grid safe.&nbsp;</p><p>Braham wanted to refute it, but he held back. It was because he thought tears would flow if he opened his mouth.</p><p class="box-notification fs-17">Sᴇarch the <b>NovᴇlFɪre .ɴᴇt</b> website on Gøøglᴇ to access chapters of nøvels early and in the highest quality.</p></div><h2>Chapter 1854</h2><div><p>[The culprit of the hell distortion has disappeared.]</p><p>[The distortion of hell is released.]</p><p>[The demon energy infesting hell has started to be purified around the areas where you and Demon Slayer ‘Yura’ have left traces.]</p><p>[Your divinity flows through the veins of hell where flames flow.]</p><p>[Your divinity takes root in the desolate land of hell.]</p><p>[Green sprouts are blooming everywhere in hell.]</p><p>[The malice and madness of the demons and demonic creatures are slowly subsided.]</p><p>[Hell has regained its original form.]</p><p>[You are deeply praised for fighting against the oppression that could have lasted forever.]</p><p>Regaining the ‘original appearance’—that was the most important conclusion. It was over. Following Baal’s death, the red piece of flesh also perished. The wishes of the world and Grid’s purpose had been fulfilled.</p><p>It was the result of Grid, the Overgeared members, the apostles, and Biban working together. In the future, death would be a respite for humanity, not the beginning of eternal suffering.</p><p>“Everyone... I’m glad everyone is safe.”</p><p>They had struggled so much. They fought really well. Etc, etc.</p><p>He had a lot to say but this was all Grid could barely spit out. It was enough. The affection that Grid and his colleagues felt for each other was naturally conveyed without words.</p><p>“You should rest.”</p><p>In any case, now wasn’t the right time to start talking. The most important enemy still remained.</p><p>Evil God Asura—Grid left the scene immediately to kill him, followed by Yura’s group.</p><p>“What do you mean by rest? Let’s fight and get it over with.” Those were Toban’s words.</p><p>Grid chuckled. Personally, he was grateful to Toban. Toban had naturally declined with the fall of the Judar Church. Later, he became a paladin belonging to the Overgeared God Church and was stronger than he was during his prime, but he didn’t rise to the ranks of the 10 Meritorious Retainers. His position was rather low despite his seniority.</p><p>In particular, he was exploited a lot by Lauel due to his experience as a staff member during his time in the Tzedakah Guild. He was responsible for guiding the new guild members while also being in charge of all sorts of tasks, such as supervising the territories in each region. He even participated in this expedition without receiving a dragon weapon.</p><p>Since he wasn’t a transcendent or an angel, he was unable to handle a dragon weapon. This meant he wasn’t actually a candidate for the expedition. After Vantner, it was difficult to find a player who was more of a pure tank than Toban, so they hurriedly recruited him in the end.</p><p>It must’ve been very embarrassing. He seemed very anxious. However, he survived to the end and proved that he was still on active duty. He fought really well. Yura, who was alive and well, was the proof.</p><p>“Yes, let’s fight together and go back together.”</p><p>Yura, Faker, and Mir were all on the taciturn side. Leraje seemed very nervous. Perhaps she was affected by the news of Beriache’s resurrection. At the very least, the atmosphere felt relaxed because there was Toban.</p><p>‘Asura.’</p><p>It was right to see him as stronger than Baal in terms of the current flow of events. Honestly, Grid was really tired. He remembered the difficulties he had throughout the fight with Baal and his eyes darkened a bit.</p><p>However, he gradually felt relieved when he remembered the faces of his colleagues. No matter how strong Asura was, he was different from Baal. Unlike Baal, who overcame death using people’s fear of him, it was the end once Asura died. Just in case—</p><p>Even if he had the setting of inheriting Baal’s power and overcoming death, it was just the setting. The fear of humanity had already been erased. People no longer feared Baal or hell.</p><p>Grid made this happen. The source of fear had been removed. There was no reason to fight alone against Asura. There were Yura, Faker, Mir, Toban, and Leraje here. There were also Biban and the angels who were currently fighting Asura. Additionally, there was Bunhelier, who was still hiding in Grid's cloak, and Grid's other companions, who would come running after completing their respective missions.</p><p>They would join forces and fight.</p><p>‘There is no suspense in many against one.’</p><p>Was it the usual many against one?</p><p>Grid, Biban, Braham, and Bunhelier—there were four Absolutes in this place.</p><p>Mercedes, Piaro, Mir, and Zik also had the potential to aim to become an Absolute and they had indeed developed at a tremendous rate. Most of the rest of the Overgeared members were transcendents. There were also strong allies called Leraje and Eligos. Even Fire Dragon Trauka couldn’t handle a pincer attack of this magnitude.</p><p>‘...Isn’t this too strong?’</p><p>He realized it once again. If they finished the expedition safely today and returned to the surface.</p><p>First of all, all the dragons in the world, including the Old Dragons, would erase their presence. They wouldn’t be able to act recklessly as long as the Overgeared World was in good shape.</p><p>‘The gods of Asgard will also be watching us with bated breath.’</p><p>Hell, who had been opposing the surface, had been destroyed. Asgard couldn’t hope for the Overgeared World’s self-destruction and would obviously be nervous.</p><p>Once he thought up to here, he naturally thought about what to do next.</p><p>‘The Seven Malignant Saints.’</p><p>The Seven Good People were Asgard’s disgrace. They were the ones who proved the sins committed by the gods. Perhaps the celestial gods would try to erase everything related to the Seven Malignant Saints after carefully watching the epic of how he brought down hell. It was in order to not give an excuse for an invasion. It should be stopped.</p><p>“......?”</p><p>The underground area where Yura’s group had struggled—it was the deepest and most secretive place in hell, befitting the place where the culprit that distorted hell was hidden. The road was so narrow and winding that he couldn’t even use Shunpo. Therefore, Grid was barely able to reach the ground after running a long time, only to witness an unexpected sight.</p><p>[...It is over.]</p><p>Evil God Asura was crumbling. He was turning to ashes while surrounded by Regas, the angel who threw off his silver mask; Hao, the angel who threw off his gold mask; and Sword God Biban.</p><p>[Baal... his trick grabbed me by the ankle.]</p><p>Asura stared in disbelief at Regas, who barely coughed up a bloody breath. Then he soon found Grid and laughed.</p><p>[Well, these are all excuses. My defeat became inevitable when I failed to secure my origin.]<nf55e4> Sᴇaʀᴄh thᴇ N0vᴇlFire(.)nᴇt website on Gøøglᴇ to access chapters of nøvels early and in the highest quality.</nf55e4></p><p>Asura’s origin—it was the mass of red flesh. Asura’s true power was only displayed when combined with it. However, he failed to achieve a union. In his imperfect state, there was no way to defeat the mighty enemies, Only One God Grid and Sword God Biban. He wanted to avoid a fight because he knew it clearly, but Grid’s vigilance was too strong.</p><p>[But we will be reunited soon.]</p><p>“......?”</p><p>Grid was relieved to witness Asura dissipating in real time, only to frown. They were going to be reunited? Asura’s meaningful words bothered him a lot.</p><p>“On what grounds are you saying this?”</p><p>[...Kukuk.]</p><p>Slowly. Very barely. Asura barely raised his hand that was limp in death and pointed to the sky. The hell moon had disappeared and the sky was clear. Above it was the surface and beyond that was heaven.</p><p>[There is a call from heaven.]</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“......!!”</p><p>There wasn’t a single person who couldn’t understand the meaning of Asura’s words.</p><p>The sky.</p><p>Heaven.</p><p>Asgard.</p><p>There was only one authority. It was to summon the dead and make them angels. But surely not, the gods—</p><p>They even wanted to take away an Evil God born in hell?</p><p>[It is no use trying to call the Saintess. The existence made from Yatan’s subconscious can’t suppress me, who was born to transcend Yatan.]</p><p>Asura read Grid’s thoughts and laughed. He turned to ash at a faster rate. It was the result of responding to Asgard’s call.</p><p>[Rest assured, Grid. The greatest god.]</p><p>The greatest god—Asura wholeheartedly acknowledged Grid. He saw Grid as a better being than any other god in heaven. It was because he witnessed the process of Grid defeating Baal from Baal’s side.</p><p>[I have fighting spirit by nature. I am different from Baal. I don’t care about trash. My target is only you and the other strong existences.]</p><p>No matter what I will become when I ascend to heaven, I won’t be a threat to the surface, unlike Baal—the reason why Asura revealed this fact was simple. He hoped that the opponent who would one day receive his challenge would be relieved and devote himself to moving forward.</p><p>Of course, Grid didn’t believe it at all. There was no reason to trust an Evil God born from Baal.</p><p>[Besides, what the heavenly gods want from me is probably to get rid of Chiyou...]</p><p>Asura had inherited the power, knowledge and intelligence of Baal and Amoract. Whatever conjecture he had made, he disappeared before he could finish saying it. He soared into heaven without leaving the slightest traces behind.</p><p>“...Chiyou.”</p><p>Grid was reminded of the archangel, Metatron. He was also obsessed with Chiyou. Maybe all the heavenly gods were. To them, Chiyou was the enemy who helped Hanul escape and was the only threat to Rebecca.</p><p>‘Considering Asura’s background, it is suitable to make him Chiyou’s opponent.’</p><p>Zeratul’s position also needed to be taken into account. Didn’t he become a sinner and was locked up? As a result, the position of Martial God was vacated. If the existence of the Martial God was essential to heaven, then it made sense to make Asura the new Martial God.</p><p>‘...So Zeratul is completely abandoned?’</p><p>Grid wasn’t very comfortable because he remembered the moment when he received help (?) from Zeratul. However, it was only for a moment.</p><p>Now was the time to rejoice. Asgard’s collection of Asura was an unexpected variable, but somehow, there was little anxiety. It was because Asura didn’t have the personality to be easily used and there was no reason for him to be swayed by Asgard’s tricks. As he said earlier, the Overgeared World was so strong.</p><p>Just then, Piaro and Mercedes were seen rushing toward them. They had neatly completed the mission and came back. Additionally—</p><p>[You have encountered Pagma’s soul.]</p><p>[You have encountered Alex’s soul.]</p><p>A personal meeting came to Grid and Yura.</p><p>The class quest—it was a quest that ordinary people had completed years ago, but it was different for legendary class users. The level of difficulty was so high that they wondered if this was correct, especially when it came to the difficulty of Grid and Yura’s class quests.</p><p>The goal of the quest was to free the souls of Pagma and Alex, who had been held captive by Baal. It was a crazy quest even when looking at it now. How could a mere legend get rid of Baal and free the souls of Pagma and Alex? It was especially the case when Pagma's Successor was a blacksmith. There was no way to kill Baal through normal methods no matter how hard they tried.</p><p>‘...Damn.’</p><p>He was so sad that he was on the verge of tears.</p><p>Pagma held out his hand to Grid, who was laughing in disbelief. “My petty talent... dear friend... I don’t know if it will help... but other than this, there is no way to express my gratitude... I don't have...”</p><p>Pagma’s voice was muffled. In the first place, the form of the soul itself was blurry. It was the same as Alex’s soul. It was distinctly different from Beriache, an Absolute. They didn’t have the ability to retain their soul form.</p><p>Soon, they would arrive at the river of reincarnation, completely lose their form, and prepare for reincarnation in a new appearance.</p><p>[You have freed the soul of the hidden hero who has suffered forever.]</p><p>[The class quest for ‘Pagma's Successor’ has been completed.]</p><p>[As a reward for completing the class quest, you have learned a new sword dance.]</p><p>It was really long. The emotional Grid felt it again and spoke to Pagma’s soul, which had become even more blurred before he knew it.</p><p>“Take a good rest now.”</p><p>What more could he say?</p><p>Pagma was arguably a hero. However, it was a position that shouldn’t be celebrated. In some cases, people could judge him as a bad person. It was all irrelevant. It might not have been Pagma’s will, but he was Grid’s benefactor.</p><p>Grid had no desire to judge him. Therefore, he greeted Pagma without praise or criticism, only respect.</p><p>“……”</p><p>Pagma read Grid’s thoughts and smiled slightly. His form grew paler. The faded old dopo finally became completely transparent. Then it was revealed.</p><p>The soul of the girl hiding nervously in the dopo—it was a girl who looked exactly like Randy.</p><p>“Ah.”</p><p>Pagma had protected someone even in death. He tried to make up for some of the sins he committed in his lifetime. Grid realized this fact and finally couldn’t stand it. He shouted.</p><p>“Thanks to you... many people were saved because of you.”</p><p>I am the biggest proof standing in front of you.</p><p>The moment that Grid said this, Pagma completely disappeared. In the end, he didn’t open his mouth and just scattered with a lonely expression on his face. It was clearly the look of a sinner.</p><p>May my existence be a small comfort to him.</p><p>Grid mourned and summoned Randy. He gave Randy a chance to meet a precious friend and say goodbye properly this time. Then a little more time passed and Wendy’s soul was also gone.</p><p>“Grid!”</p><p>Peak Sword, Huroi, and Laella rushed over while shouting. There was no Braham. Come to think of it, Kraugel also hadn’t been heard from.</p><p>“It is better to search than wait here.”</p><p>Yura quickly judged after saying goodbye to Alex and she expressed her opinion. What type of conversation did they have? Her eyes were also red.</p><p>“......?”</p><p>Grid wondered for a moment before taking the handkerchief Mercedes handed him and giving it to Yura.

The souls were bewildered for a moment before smiling. Contrary to Kraugel’s thoughts, the souls were grateful to him too. It was because he shouted that Grid would surely defeat Baal and gave them hope. Thanks to him, they endured the pain for a while. This was a tremendous blessing for the souls.</p><p>“In our next life, we will return the merits to you and Grid.”</p><p>These were the words of a soul. It blurred so quickly that Kraugel couldn’t get a close look at the soul's appearance, but he could see the neatly shaved head and deep eyes. He thought this soul must’ve been a monk-like practitioner in his lifetime.</p><p>The cycle of life.</p><p>Reincarnation—Kraugel had a vague idea of the value of this concept. The souls had started to prepare for reincarnation thanks to Grid. When they were one day reborn as beasts or human beings living on the surface, maybe they would vaguely love Grid and the warriors of the expedition. Wouldn’t these feelings gather to bless Grid and the Overgeared Kingdom?</p><p>“The immortal empire.”</p><p>Just then, Eligos interjected.</p><p>“As long as their subconscious minds remember the events of their previous lives after they are reborn, even if it is just the smallest detail, the empire of Grid will be eternal. They won’t sit idly by and ignore the nation and everything that Grid has created. They will instinctively want to protect it.”</p><p>Great nations throughout history had often been born from a combination of strong military power, brilliant politicians, and good timing. It was right to express it as a gift from heaven. However, none of the nations lasted forever. In the end, they declined and collapsed.</p><p>However, the Overgeared Empire would last forever. Even though it was only a demon’s claim... Kraugel agreed with it.</p><p>“I guess so.”</p><p>Putting aside the blessings and the help of the reincarnated souls, there weren’t many forces left that could threaten the Overgeared Guild right away. If he had to name them, wouldn’t it be the Old Dragons, the Hwan Kingdom, and Asgard? Among them, the Old Dragons seemed to have deep exchanges with Grid, while Hanul and King Sobyeol of the Hwan Kingdom felt inferior. Perhaps only Asgard could disrupt Grid’s path.</p><p>It happened as Kraugel was thinking this...</p><p>“......”</p><p>Eligos stood on the cliff and watched the procession of liberated souls. Suddenly, he changed his position with high speed movement. Before anyone knew it, he climbed on top of Cerberus, drew his sword, and looked up at the sky.</p><p>“......”</p><p>Kraugel didn’t bother asking what was going on. It was because he could also sense the traces that were getting closer.</p><p>Soon—</p><p>A tremendously powerful air wave seemed to fall on them. Then a gloomy voice rang out.</p><p>“”I... must not forget my past life. I can’t obtain enlightenment in this state.””</p><p>King Daebyeol—Kraugel was familiar with the name of the soul that stopped just before falling into the still swirling river.</p><p>The son of Hanul, a God of the Beginning—a being who fell into hell after falling for the machinations of his younger brother, King Sobyeol. Finally, he was tricked by Baal and was reduced to the mass of red flesh. The episodes related to him hadn’t been revealed in detail. However, it was easy to predict how much pain he would’ve suffered just from looking at the briefly known content. He must’ve held a very deep grudge.</p><p>“”It doesn’t make sense for me, an Absolute, to perish... I have to go up to the surface in this state and meet my younger brother.””</p><p>“Does the disappearance of an Absolute make no sense? Baal also talked nonsense before he died.”</p><p>Cerberus leapt forward. He jumped off a cliff and instantly attacked King Daebyeol.</p><p>Black Knight Eligos—his strange swordsmanship, which had a history of troubling Grid for a moment, inflicted new wounds on the soul of King Daebyeol, who was already full of wounds. He pushed relentlessly at the weakened King Daebyeol in the hope of quickly plunging him into the river.</p><p>“I can’t tolerate you going against the flow of the river, which has regained its original flow. It is your story. I feel sorry for you, but I can’t let you do as you please. It could become an opportunity to cause the rules to collapse again.”</p><p>Eligos’ desire was to be the representation of hell. He hoped that people would think of him the moment they thought of hell. It was a completely different concept from being the master of hell. It was a type of honor. Therefore, Baal didn’t bother to break his aspirations. In any case, Baal was now dead and hell was regaining its original form.</p><p>Eligos dreamed of becoming the representation of hell and he was even more obsessed with his role as the gatekeeper of hell. He struggled to defend the laws of hell that had finally been restored.</p><p>Eligos and King Daebyeol clashed multiple times, causing the river to gush out every time.</p><p>A rainbow that originally wasn’t in hell came into existence. It was a sight that could only be seen thanks to the sun rising after the hell moon disappeared.</p><p>“......”</p><p>Kraugel didn’t bother to intervene. It was very foolish to act recklessly in a situation where he couldn’t judge right from wrong. It also bothered him that King Daebyeol had a deep grudge. He was undoubtedly a good being, but it was hard to predict what variables he would cause if he went up to the surface like this.</p><p>‘...I think it is better for Eligos to win.’</p><p>He never thought the day would come when he would cheer for a demon. Kraugel’s expression stiffened as he felt something strange.</p><p>“There must be a way to get to the surface without crossing the river of reincarnation.”</p><p>There was a uniquely upright existence among the souls moving while entrusting their bodies to the flow of the river. The form was also distinct. He looked like a living person, like King Daebyeol, unlike most other souls that had faded.</p><p>“...Madra?”</p><p>The name of the soul was confirmed. Then the image of the rapidly approaching soul was projected on Kraugel’s slowly widening eyes.</p><p>“I would be thankful if you teach me how to climb to the surface with my present memories and soul.”</p><p>This was Madra’s request as he closed the distance in an instant. His well-developed forearm muscles helped show what type of swordsmanship he would perform.</p><p>Kraugel was reflecting on what type of existence Madra was when Eligos shouted to him.</p><p>“They are beings who have suffered for as short a time as several years or as long as thousands of years. It is right to say that they have been twisted unconditionally, unless their innate ability is straight and strong. Don’t bother with him and ignore him.”</p><p>Don’t look at what they are like in life.</p><p>This was the key point of the warning.</p><p>Kraugel didn’t really agree. In fact, most of the souls were flowing along the river in a calm manner. It was hard to believe that the soul of a person who was called a hero in his lifetime could be twisted when even ordinary souls were like this.</p><p>Of course, this didn’t mean he intended to trust and help Madra. There was no reason for it.</p><p>“I’m an ordinary human being who doesn’t have much to do with hell... I can’t answer your question.”</p><p>“Yes, you look like an ordinary human being. You don’t seem to be dead or a demon. That is why I’m asking you. How did you get to hell? It is enough to tell me what you used.”</p><p>“Hey. Didn’t I say not to get involved?”</p><p>Eligos intervened as he briefly left King Daebyeol and returned to Kraugel’s side.</p><p>“The stronger and more special a being was in their life, the higher the bridge of their noise and the more obsessed they are with grudges. They are even more twisted than normal souls...”</p><p>Eligos’ words were cut off in the middle. It was due to Formless Will. It was Madra who wielded a sword made of formless energy.</p><p>800,000 Army Swordsmanship—it was like looking at the Space Sword. The earth split in half around the spot where Eligos stood.</p><p>“...Help me,” Eligos openly asked for help as he was surrounded by King Daebyeol and Madra, who chased after him before he knew it.</p><p>At this point, it was also hard for Kraugel to remain still. He remembered the mission given by Grid—it was the mission to cooperate with Eligos. Grid gave such a mission because he believed in Eligos. It was also right for Kraugel to believe in him. Moreover, the purification of hell had just begun. The situation wasn’t over yet and Kraugel’s mission was still ongoing.</p><p>“...I will try.”</p><p>Kraugel pulled out Twilight and gripped it.</p><p>“That isn’t ordinary.”</p><p>The expressions on the faces of King Daebyeol and Madra became serious.</p><p>It was a tense moment.</p><p>‘This aura?’</p><p>Madra had been watching closely after realizing that Kraugel’s true identity was the Sword Saint. Then he suddenly shifted his gaze in the direction of the river. It was because he detected a presence he had been missing for many years.</p><p>“Pagma...”</p><p>One of the people he always wanted to meet. It wasn’t in a good way.</p><p>Madra’s face strangely contorted as he remembered the humiliation of being resurrected and used as a death knight by this bastard, as well as the loneliness and pain that he had to endure because of it.</p><p>“I... if I can help you even a little bit... can I?” Pagma’s soul rose from the river and slowly approached the scene. He was a shabby figure compared to Madra, let alone King Daebyeol. He was very blurred in form like most ordinary souls. Pagma’s soul was so weak that it wouldn’t be strange if he disappeared right away. His voice wasn’t connected properly.</p><p>However, Kraugel believed in him. It was because he was one of the origins of Grid. Regardless of his outward appearance, he would never be weak.</p><p>It was also now after Pagma had just witnessed the activities of his successor. It was highly likely that he got great inspiration and trained his mental image.</p><p>“I will be happy for your help.” Kraugel’s answer was the signal.</p><p>[You have been possessed by the soul of the Legendary Blacksmith ‘Pagma.’]</p><p>[Pagma’s Sword Dance is activated.]</p><p>[The Legendary Blacksmith’s Craftsmanship Skill is activated.]</p><p>It was just like how Grid united with Braham’s soul in the past. Kraugel also became one with the soul of a legend. It was such a historic moment that Eligos’ eyes filled with anticipation. However, reality was terrible.</p><p>[Your swordsmanship level is higher than Pagma’s Sword Dance.]</p><p>In the past, when Grid became one with Braham, he gained a strong intelligence stat along with the opening of the ability called magic, but the combination of Kraugel and Pagma had little synergy.</p><p>Pagma had only reached the level of a great swordsman before signing a contract with Baal, so he was unable to help Kraugel with his swordsmanship. The only stats that Pagma increased was dexterity, which didn’t help much in battle.</p><p>“......”</p><p>It was the wrong fusion. Pagma read Kraugel’s inwardly disturbed mind and hurriedly recovered it. He examined the number of swords in Kraugel’s inventory and activated a hidden secret skill.</p><p>“Item Combination.”</p><p>“......!”</p><p>Kraugel trembled. A technique that combined two or more items into one to amplify power—it was one of Grid’s ultimate moves. Kraugel had witnessed how powerful it was several times so his expectations soared to the extreme.</p><p>That’s right. He didn’t know. It was the fact that Item Combination required a ‘process’ to go through.</p><p>Ttang! Ttang! Ttang!</p><p>“...Are you crazy?”</p><p>Kraugel crouched down despite the enemies in front of him, took out the Grid-made repair hammer and anvil, and started pounding on his sword. This caused Eligos to be engulfed in a sense of crisis like never before.</p><p>At the same time, at the entrance of the hell elevator...</p><p>“......”</p><p>An innately born Absolute—Braham admired, was thrilled with, overwhelmed by, and then defeated by his mother, who absorbed the power of Baal and Amoract and showed off her perfect appearance. Then his fighting spirit, which had weakened, came back to life.</p><p>It was because the presence of a certain bastard became very clear.</p><p>Pagma—he had heard Pagma’s hidden story several times through Grid’s mouth and tried to understand and forgive him somehow, but it was impossible. The moment he felt this presence, the resentment he had tried to forget boiled over. He wanted to make sure to meet Pagma and make him pay for his sins before Pagma jumped into the convenient feature of reincarnation and forgot everything. To do so, he had to overcome the crisis facing him right now.</p><p>“Let me ask you one last time. Can’t you give up on Marie Rose?”</p><p>“”Then there is no reason in giving birth to that child.””</p><p>“...I will fight with the intention of killing you. Please forgive me.”</p><p>His most respected and beloved mother in the world—Braham hadn’t dared to resent her even when he was banished. Now he made a resolution that he never could’ve imagined in the past. It wasn’t because he felt sorry for Marie Rose. It was only for Grid’s sake and to kill Pagma.<nf16d5> Sᴇaʀᴄh thᴇ n0vᴇl(ꜰ)ire.ɴet website on Gøøglᴇ to access chapters of nøvels early and in the highest quality.</nf16d5></p><p>As if hypnotizing himself, Braham’s magic power soared with no end in sight.</p><p>Braham-style Enhanced Mana Drain—the power that even Baal coveted engulfed all of the surrounding magic power.

It was a sound that made one realize that times had changed. </p><p>It happened as Black Knight Eligos was immersed in strange emotions... </p><p>“...Wait.” </p><p>Madra’s soul restrained the soul of King Daebyeol. It was an obstruction that was difficult to understand from the perspective of King Daebyeol. </p><p>The disruptor who suddenly started hammering in the middle of battle—he missed the opportunity to beat this arrogant person. </p><p>Madra explained it to him, “Pagma is good at deceiving and taking advantage of others. To put it simply, he is an ill-bred bastard. You will be in trouble if you trust the openly exposed gaps he shows.” </p><p>“”Huh... How far has my father fallen...?””</p><p>King Daebyeol lamented after vaguely sensing that Pagma was a being created by his father, Hanul. He heard Madra’s words and was concerned about how many people were harmed by Hanul’s sin of creating a being who was close to a demon. </p><p>“......”</p><p>The content of the conversation between the two of them was clearly heard in Kraugel’s ears. Naturally, it was also heard by Pagma. </p><p>Kraugel could feel the emotions of Pagma, who was possessing him. Sadness, remorse, loneliness... </p><p>But there was no regret. He was certain that his choices and actions wouldn’t change even if he went back to the past. It was the stubbornness of a hero who had already saved the world once. It was a stubbornness that shouldn’t be broken. </p><p>“It is over.” </p><p>Madra’s vigilance turned into an opportunity. Thanks to this, Pagma succeeded in combining Twilight and the White Tiger Sword into one and entrusted the rest to Kraugel. </p><p>“Unfortunately, this is all I can do to help.” </p><p>It wasn’t humility. </p><p>[Your swordsmanship level is higher than Pagma’s Sword Dance.] </p><p>[All the intentions contained in Pagma’s Sword Dance can be fully accomplished with your swordsmanship.] </p><p>[Pagma’s Sword Dance is disabled.] </p><p>The system judged that it would be a loss for Kraugel to use Pagma’s Sword Dance. It forcibly prevented him from using it. The skills that were so powerful in Grid’s hands were useless... </p><p>‘Grid, what type of fights have you been fighting...?’ </p><p>It was the same with Pagma’s Sword Dance and the Item Combination skill. In both cases, the original skill was far from perfect. They were badly flawed until they evolved in Grid’s hands. Additionally, Pagma’s stats were low. Apart from dexterity, most of the major stats such as strength, stamina, agility, and intelligence were inferior to Kraugel. </p><p>It was regrettable even considering the fact that Kraugel had already surpassed the legends of the previous generation. If Grid had stayed as Pagma's Successor, Grid’s peak would’ve been Pagma and he would’ve never been able to achieve the same feats as he did now. </p><p>Using this newfound understanding, Kraugel realized that Grid was a greater person than he thought. Grid changed his destiny after crossing his limits several times. </p><p>“I have more things to ask of you. Give me Pagma’s soul, along with a way to get to the surface,” Undefeated King Madra said while inflating the muscles of his right arm that was holding the sword. </p><p>Kraugel felt it before, but Madra was a very strange existence. He wasn’t a legend and was just a soul. How could he be so strong? In particular, Kraugel had witnessed the dilemma of the ‘Undefeated King’s Swordsmanship’ several times. </p><p>An incredibly powerful swordsmanship that damaged the arms of the user—even Baal from a few months ago, as well as Grid of the past, used to have ragged arms every time they used the Undefeated King’s Swordsmanship. </p><p>However, Madra’s soul casually used 800,000 Army Swordsmanship. Kraugel wasn’t convinced even considering that Madra was the original master of the swordsmanship. </p><p>‘Is it because he is a soul that he isn’t restricted?’ </p><p>No, it was also problematic to interpret it this way. Right now, Pagma’s soul was in such a precarious state that he would’ve disappeared immediately if he hadn’t possessed Kraugel. It meant it was difficult for the deceased who were about to reincarnate to maintain their soul bodies. Yet Madra was doing it without any difficulty. It was like the Absolute, King Daebyeol. </p><p>“He was born a strong existence.” Eligos came to a conclusion after feeling the same doubts as Kraugel. “He is simply a being born with a strong body and soul. That guy is like that.” </p><p>“......” </p><p>Kraugel was forced to agree. There was no other way to explain Madra’s strength. In this way, some of the doubts about his futile end were solved. </p><p>The king of Lubana, a small kingdom—the man who single-handedly prevented the advance of the Empire with overwhelming force. Madra was the most powerful man of his time. However, the Empire concealed this information to prevent his reputation from spreading outside of Lubana. As a result, he lost his life in vain to a dagger wielded by his son and failed to become a legend. </p><p>It was a death with many unanswered questions. He might not be a legend, but it was hard to believe that such a strong person died in vain at the hands of his son. It was an established theory in the academic community that a separate truth related to Madra’s death existed. </p><p>But now looking at it, Kraugel thought that it was the truth. </p><p>Madra died in vain at the hands of his son. The essence of Madra was that he was simply a ‘strong human being.’ He was just strong and didn’t have overwhelming senses, so he was stabbed in a vital spot in a vain end. He wasn’t immune when he was fatally wounded. The conclusion— </p><p>‘He is a monster in a different sense.’ </p><p>A powerhouse different from ordinary legends and transcendents—Kraugel’s expression was serious as he analyzed Madra. </p><p>A being who refused to reincarnate—as Eligos said, he was a variable who sought to overthrow the law of hell that had just been restored. </p><p>Kraugel couldn’t just stand by. Kraugel had an obligation to uphold the laws of hell as long as Grid was the one who restored them. That was his role as a colleague. </p><p>“You are going to fight. Yes... it won’t be easy to get back to the surface.” </p><p>Madra’s thoughts changed. The muscles of his hand and arm holding the formless sword wriggled and the blood vessels bulged. The air around the area sank heavily. It was as if he alone existed in the world. He showed an overwhelming presence and focused the attention of those around him to himself. It was enough to make the souls flowing in the river of reincarnation stop for a moment and look up at the cliff. </p><p>“One Million Army Massacre Sword.” </p><p>The ultimate move that Baal showed in the past—it was executed through the hands of its creator. The sword energy with supreme power stretched out horizontally. He was poised to cut everything around him, including Kraugel. </p><p>‘This is crazy.’ </p><p>It happened as a chill went down Eligos’ spine... </p><p>A small bursting sound was heard. Then the sword energy that covered the world was lifted. It was the aftermath of Kraugel’s Space Sword cutting the One Million Army Massacre Sword. It was a very natural phenomenon. </p><p>Originally, a Sword Saint was a being who had the sword energy to cut anything and the strongest swordsmanship. Madra might’ve been classified as the ‘greatest talent of all time’ and mentioned in the mouths of Absolutes, but even he couldn’t defeat Kraugel when it came to swordsmanship. </p><p>Kraugel’s swordsmanship was judged to be unconditionally superior to Madra’s. Of course, the strongest sword that he obtained thanks to Pagma was a great help. </p><p>Madra wasn’t flustered. “In the first place, it is a swordsmanship designed to kill a million enemies.” </p><p>It was with these meaningful words. The One Million Army Massacre Sword, which had been cut in half by the Space Sword, suddenly had its trajectory twisted. It resembled a windmill. It rotated, targeted the area, and started to devastate it. </p><p>A swordsmanship designed to kill a million enemies—there was no way that the sword trajectory could be limited to one. The number of sword trajectories made by One Million Army Massacre Sword was almost infinite. This was the essence of it that Baal had overlooked. In other words, it was by no means a level that could be suppressed by blocking it once. </p><p>A large shadow rose behind Kraugel’s back as he retreated, slashed at the incoming swords, or spread out a sword curtain to block them. It was the gatekeeper of hell. It was Cerberus, a beast that appeared in many large-scale myths. Madra’s advance was blocked thanks to the guy who released flames and poison to stop the One Million Army Massacre Sword. </p><p>A cooperation with a demon and demonic creature—it was a sight that could’ve never been seen in the time when Pagma was alive. </p><p>Pagma recalled his memories of the Behen Archipelago. He remembered the time when he signed a contract with Baal and fought against demons with the power he gained. The demons and demonic creatures that Pagma experienced at that time were monsters united with hostility and the intent to kill. It was hard to imagine a day would come when humans would cooperate with them. It was to the point where he felt that there was no hope for humanity, who would forever be their target. </p><p>“If only Grid had inherited the power of someone other than me... the world would’ve been saved a bit earlier.” </p><p>By inheriting my power, his growth was slowed and the salvation of the world was delayed. It took too long for hope to take root... </p><p>The cause of Pagma’s self-blame was naturally Kraugel. Since Kraugel’s impression of Pagma’s Successor was somewhat insignificant, Pagma also realized his inadequacies. </p><p>“......”<nf8e41> Sᴇaʀᴄh the NƟvelFɪre.ɴet website on Gøøglᴇ to access chapters of nøvels early and in the highest quality.</nf8e41></p><p>Kraugel felt no guilt. It was because his own impression as a third party was useless. He cooperated with Cerberus to cut off Madra’s arm and spoke calmly, “It is thanks to inheriting your power that the present Grid can exist.” </p><p>It wasn’t an empty consolation. </p><p>Kraugel only told the truth as he confirmed the value in the increase of his critical hit chance and weak point hitting probability, which increased significantly due to the dexterity stat that Pagma raised, and as he recognized the power of Twilight combined with the White Tiger Sword. </p><p>“It is terrifying to imagine if someone other than Grid inherited your power.” </p><p>Some people said it—the development of players was delayed and humanity was in crisis because Grid only supplied the items he created to the Overgeared Guild. </p><p>Kraugel’s view was different. Since it was Grid, he identified people he could trust and distributed his works properly. If someone other than Grid had acquired Pagma's Successor and monopolized the production of legendary items... </p><p>People with only money and power, but no qualifications, would monopolize the most powerful weapons. Then humanity might not have been able to overcome its many crises. </p><p>“Don’t comfort the worthless,” Madra interrupted. He pointed out Kraugel’s attitude of soothing Pagma’s soul. “He is a wicked man.” </p><p>Kraugel’s face darkened. To be precise, it was the face of Pagma, who had become one with Kraugel. Pagma’s feelings were expressed through Kraugel’s body. Kraugel didn’t hand over the right to speak to Pagma, who wanted to apologize to Madra. </p><p>“You seem to be mistaken.” </p><p>Undefeated King Madra—he had received the evaluation that he would’ve become the strongest human being if he had enjoyed his natural life. Was it really like that? This evaluation of Madra was built on the days when ‘players didn’t exist.’ It was a time without Grid, the Overgeared Guild, and Kraugel. </p><p>“I wasn’t comforting Pagma. I was just appreciating Grid...” </p><p>“......”</p><p>Kraugel had already said everything he wanted to say. His words casually inserted the knife into Pagma’s chest again while he slashed off Madra’s remaining left arm. </p><p>Madra, who had died hundreds of years ago and hadn’t developed, couldn’t be the opponent of the present day Sword Saint, who had been acknowledged by Muller. Furthermore, Kraugel was holding a dragon weapon made by Grid and strengthened by Pagma. </p><p>Madra’s soul fell off the cliff and was submerged in the river of reincarnation. He drifted away to welcome a new life. </p><p>“May you be happy in your next life.” </p><p>The king of Lubana—he, who fought to defend his kingdom and his people, deserved a better fate... </p><p>The appearance of Kraugel as he thought this and sincerely mourned gave King Daebyeol goosebumps. </p><p>“”Do you acknowledge that he is a hero and mourn for him after brutally cutting him down... hell has started to be purified and demons are regaining their goodness, while humans have become rather cruel.”” </p><p>“......”</p><p>Kraugel didn’t feel it was worth arguing over. The other person might be full of wounds, but he was still an Absolute. Kraugel was busy calculating how to deal with the great enemy called King Daebyeol. His conclusion— </p><p>‘It is hard.’ </p><p>An Absolute was an existence that was definitely higher than Sword Saint Muller. He wasn’t an opponent who could be defeated just by working together with Eligos and Cerberus. It happened as Kraugel’s expression was getting darker and darker... </p><p>“...gel!” </p><p>He heard someone’s voice from a distance. It wasn’t just the cries of one or two people. Many presences were approaching quickly. They were the Overgeared members, except for Grid, and the apostles, except for Braham. Biban was also with them. </p><p>“I can’t fight anymore.” However, Biban collapsed as soon as he arrived at the scene. He lay down and leaned against a rock like he was sleeping. It was fine. Except for Biban, the people who gathered at the scene were in good condition. </p><p>“I feel a bit worse about what I look like...?” </p><p>“Really? What?” </p><p>It happened as Peak Sword and Vantner were praising Kraugel, who had become more handsome after combining with Pagma... </p><p>“”Why are you disturbing me?””</p><p>Countless flowers bloomed around the lamenting King Daebyeol.</p><p class="box-notification fs-17">Sᴇarch the <b>n0vᴇl(ꜰ)ire.ɴet</b> website on Gøøglᴇ to access chapters of nøvels early and in the highest quality.</p></div><h2>Chapter 1857</h2><div><p>Chapter 1856</p><p>To save one world—Grid had already experienced how hard it was in the East Continent. It took more than five years to unseal the Four Auspicious Beasts. He experienced so many things while traveling between the East Continent and West Continent. </p><p>Furthermore, this expedition was to save two worlds at the same time: hell and the surface. It was normal to be tired. </p><p>‘I was naive to believe that killing Baal would end everything.’ </p><p>Braham and Kraugel hadn’t returned. Grid, who was anxious about what was happening at this moment, calmed himself down. Rather than being dissatisfied with the unfinished situation, he found a way to understand and deal with it. </p><p>Leraje was a big help. </p><p>“I think Eligos is still at the river of reincarnation. I can feel Cerberus’ presence.” </p><p>Cerberus, the gatekeeper of hell—he seemed to deny Noe’s claim that the memphis was the strongest demonic creature of hell. Unlike Noe, who did nothing to help throughout the fight with Baal, Cerberus showed an unflinching spirit toward anyone who was his opponent. The proof was that he attacked Grid at Eligos’ will. </p><p>Seeing the way that Leraje reacted sensitively to Cerberus’ presence, it seemed that the great demons also highly valued Cerberus. Leraje tracked the location of Eligos and Kraugel based on Cerberus’ whereabouts. </p><p>Perhaps her attitude encouraged a competitive spirit, but the till then silent Noe spoke out shamelessly, “He is simply so big that he stands out.” </p><p>Grid ignored him. He wasn’t particularly disappointed in Noe even though Noe seemed useless against enemies such as Baal and the dragons. It was because the opponents were too terrible. The moment they returned to the surface, Noe would be able to reign as the guardian god of the Overgeared Empire. </p><p>Yes, strength was relative. Noe was strong enough and a great helper. </p><p>‘...Cancel summoning.’ </p><p>Grid looked affectionately at Noe, only to frown. It was because he found that Noe had a black mouse in his mouth. </p><p>Evil Dragon Bunhelier—he had polymorphed into a black mouse and had been hiding in Grid’s cloak, only to be bitten on the back by Noe. </p><p>‘This is crazy.’ </p><p>A chill went down Grid’s spine as he watched the Old Dragon he had reluctantly claimed as a companion. He was at a loss for words and bewildered. Then Bunhelier told him, “You don’t have to worry. Mere creatures driven by instinct are part of providence. Squeak."</p><p>‘...He is generous in strange areas.’ </p><p>No, it wasn’t generosity. It was more like an attitude of not caring about trivial matters. It was like people didn’t care about the ants they stepped on, even though it didn’t look very good.</p><p>At this moment— </p><p>“......!” </p><p>The world shook. It felt like it was split in half. A tremendous wave of power came from the direction of the river of reincarnation. Grid immediately knew what this power was. There was no way he couldn’t notice. Out of all the legends of the past, he was the one with the deepest connection to Grid apart from Pagma and Braham. </p><p>Undefeated King Madra—the familiar ripples of the swordsmanship Grid had been implementing originated from the river of reincarnation. </p><p>Like Grid, Biban grasped the situation and murmured, “There is a reason why my junior was stranded.” </p><p>He was clearly aware of the situation of Kraugel, who seemed to be colliding with Madra, but he didn’t seem nervous. It was the same for Grid. It was clear that Madra was a powerful man from a previous era who deserved to be respected, but Kraugel’s value far exceeded Madra’s. </p><p>In terms of achievements and force—who could deny that Kraugel surpassed Madra in every way? In the first place, Madra was classified as a swordsman. He might be able to release the One Million Army Swordsmanship, but he wouldn’t be able to compete with Kraugel as long as it was in swordsmanship. </p><p>However, Grid couldn’t be relieved. The fact that Madra’s soul was active meant that something had gone wrong with the river of reincarnation. Beings other than Madra might be holding back Kraugel and Eligos. In particular, Grid was concerned about the consequences of the disappearance of the red flesh. It was because the raw material of the red flesh was the son of a God of the Beginning. </p><p>“If the soul of a mere legend is flourishing... when it comes to the soul of an Absolute, you can’t grasp the subject at all. Squeak.” </p><p>Coincidentally, Bunhelier seemed to have also thought about King Daebyeol.</p><p>“Take people to the river of reincarnation,” Grid requested of Yura.</p><p>The fact that Kraugel might be in danger was a secondary issue. Grid was more worried that the river of reincarnation would collapse. </p><p>“Yes,” Yura agreed to the request. She changed course toward the river of reincarnation and the others immediately followed. </p><p>Biban and the apostles were with her. They also realized the importance of this task. There was the threat of hell being distorted into another form the moment the river of reincarnation collapsed. This meant that all the work done to get rid of Baal and the red flesh, and to stop Asura, could be in vain. </p><p>For now, it was right to do everything in their power to protect the river of reincarnation. In the first place, it was enough for Grid to search for Braham alone. The relationship between a god and his apostles was so strong that it was superior to any other concept. </p><p>“Let’s finish it perfectly this time.” </p><p>Then meet again without any worries. </p><p>Grid left behind these words of goodbye to his colleagues who were trying not to show signs of exhaustion. Then Grid used Shunpo and constantly changed his position.</p><p>The hell cleared of darkness and lava—Grid used Shunpo continuously with the momentum of going around this whole place, which was as huge as the surface. As a result, the world was covered with a sunset. It was the aftermath of the remnants of orange divinity remaining in each area where Grid appeared. </p><p>The demonkin accepted the sight as a blessing from the gods. </p><p>The demonkin—there were variations depending on the individual, but unlike demons and demonic creatures, they were the inhabitants of hell who lived in the neutral zone while maintaining their sense of reason. They interpreted it as the god of the surface sprinkling beautiful divinity on them to bless their future after he restored peace in hell. </p><p>[The inhabitants of hell worship you.] </p><p>[In the undistorted hell, the weight of your name is equal to that of the God of the Beginning, Yatan.] </p><p>[A part of the purified hell has started to be incorporated into the Overgeared World.] </p><p>Apart from the events that continued to occur after Baal’s death, hell was constantly undergoing the right changes. Putting aside Grid’s fatigue and tension, the situation was stabilizing. Sooner or later, the perfect outcome that Grid hoped for would arrive. </p><p>Then what was this growing anxiety? </p><p>Grid’s expression crumpled as he sped up the pace in which he used Shunpo. He felt motion sickness due to the changing scenery around him and was overwhelmed with anxiety because he couldn’t detect Braham’s traces at all. </p><p>‘...A barrier.’ </p><p>At this point, there was only one reason why he couldn’t feel Braham. Braham himself was rejecting Grid. It was clear that he didn’t want Grid to find him and had done something about it. Why? It was obvious. </p><p>‘He is with Beriache.’ </p><p>Grid had been suspicious of Beriache, whose whereabouts were unknown. He assumed a situation where Beriache became an ‘enemy.’ He also understood Braham’s position. </p><p>The only one he loved and admired—it was an expression used by Braham in the past to describe his mother. </p><p>‘Braham doesn’t want me to fight Beriache.’ </p><p>He was going to take care of it on his own... </p><p>Grid went crazy at this thought and distributed all his stat points to intelligence. Subsequently— </p><p>“Magic Missile.”</p><p>He started to fire magic along with the 300 God Hands. It was the most basic magic. However, it was a Braham-style enhanced type. Depending on the caster’s capabilities, it had the potential to exert power comparable to great magic. And at this time, Grid’s intelligence transcended Braham’s. There were also as many as 300 God Hands implementing some of Grid’s stats. </p><p>Unusually silent spots that gave off an eerie feeling—these strangely serene points were set as the bombardment locations of Magic Missile and were devastated. One of them was near the hell elevator. </p><p>[Braham’s Barrier has been destroyed.] </p><p>Bingo. </p><p>The barrier that he couldn’t distinguish was disastrously broken. Then the true scene was reflected in Grid’s eyes. There were signs of destruction all around the elevator. There was also a silver-haired man lying in the center of it. It was Braham. </p><p>“This... what an ignorant method...?” </p><p>Braham was devastated when he witnessed the destruction of the barrier that couldn’t cope with the power of pure magic. He looked at Grid like he was a monster. Grid glared at him as he lay sprawled out while covered in wounds. It was while checking the elevator that had just been activated. </p><p>“Beriache has already left for the surface.” </p><p>“She left a little while ago. There is no need to be angry. She has no intention of doing any harm to the surface. Therefore, I didn’t betray you...” </p><p>“......”</p><p>Grid’s distorted expression didn’t loosen up at all. He felt betrayed by Braham and tried to suppress his soaring anger, but there was a limit. </p><p>“How can I believe that? Braham, you might want to trust Beriache, but I can’t trust her at all.” </p><p>Grid didn’t even care about Braham’s condition. He ignored Braham and pressed the button on the elevator. The noise of the descending elevator eroded the scene that was filled with an uncomfortable silence. Finally, just as the elevator arrived... </p><p>“...I’m sorry,” Braham finally opened his mouth. It was an apology. It was a look he had only shown a few times despite the fact that they had been together for quite a long time. </p><p>“By the time you arrive, Mother would’ve already died,” Braham assured Grid, who entered the elevator without responding. </p><p>Braham had vowed never to troll again. Today, he faithfully fulfilled his role even though he might’ve deceived Grid. After a fierce struggle, he weakened his mother. Beriache might’ve absorbed the power of Baal and Amoract, but she had a limit in her soul body. </p><p>In the first place, Braham was stronger than people thought. </p><p>The God of Magic and Wisdom—as a god with two modifiers, he was on the level of claiming to be the strongest among the apostles. </p><p>“Maybe Marie Rose has already hurt her...” </p><p>Braham’s voice trembled as he barely managed to speak. He was struggling to contain his grief. He, who had done his best to protect Grid’s companion—putting aside his love for his mother, he had done everything in his power to distract her. As a result, it was Braham’s judgment that the weakened Beriache could not cope with Marie Rose. </p><p>“If... if Marie Rose showed mercy to her, and my mother is still alive...” </p><p>“......” </p><p>“I hope you can let her go in a painless manner.” </p><p>Braham’s rare request softened Grid’s expression. The answer from Grid flowed through the crack in the elevator’s slowly closing doors. </p><p>“I will try.” </p><p>It was enough. Now Braham had only one wish left. When his mother, who failed to resurrect and was about to die again, was reborn— <nf75c9> Sᴇaʀᴄh thᴇ NovᴇlFɪre .ɴᴇt website on Gøøglᴇ to access chapters of nøvels early and in the highest quality.</nf75c9></p><p>He hoped she could recognize him.</p><p class="box-notification fs-17">Sᴇarch the <b>NƟvelFɪre.ɴet</b> website on Gøøglᴇ to access chapters of nøvels early and in the highest quality.</p></div><h2>Chapter 1858</h2><div><p>Chapter 1857</p><p>There were no mirrors in Marie Rose’s castle. </p><p>A face that was praised by the whole world for being beautiful—it was because the existence of ‘I’ faded every time she looked at this face. </p><p>“It wasn’t like this from the beginning.” </p><p>Marie Rose raised herself up from the pure white coffin and looked up at the throne. A small soul was approaching the throne, which had been untouched for so many years and had gathered dust. It was while casually asking the question about why there were no mirrors in the woman’s palace. </p><p>“I once cherished and loved my face, which looked just like yours.” </p><p>A faint smile spread across Marie Rose’s face as she recalled the past from hundreds of years ago. It was a time when she loved her reflection in the mirror. She had laughed quite often back then. It was because her face became a tool to remember her mother. It was proof that she was her mother’s daughter and that she had a family. </p><p>Her heart had warmed. It was warm enough to soothe the body and mind that had been cursed. Then little by little, the years went by and she started to grow taller. </p><p>Marie Rose gradually got a strange feeling. It was shortly after confirming that her grown body was more powerful than before. </p><p>“You will transcend me.” </p><p>The words that her mother told her before dying never left her head. </p><p>Transcend. Yes, her mother clearly said it. </p><p>You are going to go beyond me. Kill Baal using this power and release my resentment. </p><p>This meant that Marie Rose’s growth was a very natural result. It was a demonstration of the value of a creature born at the expense of Beriache’s own life. However, a question arose. </p><p>Do I really need to look like my mother? </p><p>One day, Marie Rose stood in front of the mirror and examined herself very closely. It was from head to toe. She felt a sense of strangeness from her appearance, which looked exactly like her mother as she grew up. The more she compared herself to her older siblings, who looked so different from her mother, the most suspicious she became. She didn’t know the reason. </p><p>Did she need to be like her mother? The more she thought about it, the deeper the anxiety that crept into her mind. </p><p>In fact, it wasn’t a matter to think deeply about. There was no need to be anxious. Her mother was dead. It was enough for Marie Rose to live her life after fulfilling her obligations. Nevertheless, her instincts cried out to her. </p><p>Be suspicious of the situation. Neglect your duty. </p><p>It wasn’t a coincidence. It was a warning delivered from the knowledge and information that her mother had passed onto her. It wasn’t known exactly what the warning was about. It was proof that the knowledge and information she inherited from her mother was incomplete. Marie Rose was vaguely aware that her mother had deliberately concealed some information from her. </p><p>Then she was reunited with Braham. At first, he was her mother’s enemy. He had the same attitude as the past and barked nonsense like a dog. Then shortly after she promised to marry Grid, Braham came to her castle for the first time and spoke ‘words’ rather than barking. </p><p>“You are Mother’s ideal. It is necessary for you to behave properly.” </p><p>Ideal—this terrible word was a wake-up call to Marie Rose. It was a wake-up call that revealed the true nature of the anxiety she had been feeling. </p><p>That’s right—Marie Rose was Beriache’s ideal. It wasn’t just innate strength and personal appearance. Marie Rose was the ultimate being Beriache had hoped for. </p><p>Why did her mother give birth to her? Was it purely for revenge? She didn’t think so... </p><p>“”I loved you once,”” the small figure sitting on the throne said. </p><p>The torches that started to burn in response to her magic cleared away the darkness of the great hall. The appearance was soon revealed to be that of a little girl. The identity of the person sitting on the throne was Beriache’s soul. She was covered with wounds. </p><p>If the method to maintain the soul wasn’t magic power, mental power, and ‘desire,’ perhaps she would’ve disappeared immediately—Beriache’s soul was in such a bad state that people couldn’t help thinking this. All the wounds were presumed to have been caused by powerful magic. The amount of magic power that rose and leaked like smoke seemed considerable. </p><p>“”Thank you, and I’m sorry.””</p><p>Beriache’s origin was the underground area of Reidan Desert. It was the aftermath of her taking this place as her home after being expelled from hell. Thanks to that, the magic power of all the vampire cities in the desert flocked to Beriache. It gave a distinct form to her soul, which had been repeatedly blurring due to the magic power leaking from the wounds. </p><p>“Mother!” There was a being who witnessed the magic power returning to its origin and rushed over in surprise. He was the only ‘survivor’ of the direct descendants apart from Braham and Marie Rose. It was Noll. He inherited the attribute of ‘compassion’ from Beriache and was very affectionate. His tears were well suited to him because he looked like a little boy. It wasn’t at all awkward for him to cry and hug his mother after reuniting with her for the first time in hundreds of years. </p><p>“...Visitors who come without permission aren’t welcome.” </p><p>“Keuk.” </p><p>There was no emotional reunion. Just before he could share a hug with his mother, Noll lost his mind and collapsed. It was due to the magic that Marie Rose had cast. </p><p>“”You are violent.”” </p><p>Beriache, who had been waiting for her son with open arms, smiled bitterly. She sensed it. </p><p>‘It won’t be easy.’ </p><p>Marie Rose’s skills, whom she witnessed used on Noll, were indeed formidable. It would’ve been possible for her to defeat Baal on her own. Well, this was a given. In the first place, Marie Rose was born to transcend her. </p><p>Beriache’s thoughts went up to here and her eyes sank. “The reason why you sacrificed yourself to give birth to me.”</p><p>Lightly—Marie Rose stepped on the fainted Noll and leapt forward to stand in front of the throne. She bent down and grabbed the armrests of the throne with both hands. She lowered her head to be at eye level with her mother, who looked exactly like her, and demanded the truth. </p><p>“It is to take over me, who will one day surpass you in every way, right?” </p><p>“”Yes... this insight is correct. I was going to use you to gain the power I couldn’t get on my own, and then take it away from you. I gave birth to you with this plan from the beginning.”” </p><p>Marie Rose and Beriache were clearly alike, but different. </p><p>Beriache’s face wrinkled the more she was in pain or sad, while Marie Rose’s eyes curved in a half moon to avoid showing it. </p><p>This child, why is she smiling? </p><p>Beriache had only given birth to her. </p><p>It happened the moment when Beriache, who didn’t know anything about Marie Rose, had this question... </p><p>The armrest of the throne that Marie Rose was holding broke. Due to this, Beriache’s arms that were resting on the armrest floated in the air for a moment. The back of the throne was terribly crushed. It was the result of the shockwave caused by Marie Rose’s raised knee being blocked by Beriache’s small hand. </p><p>“”It is a shame that we have to fight after all. If you had fought Baal yourself, rather than Grid, I would’ve resurrected when you were tired after winning and the plan would’ve been completed without much trouble.”” </p><p>“I see. Then I would’ve died without feeling betrayed.” </p><p>“”It was a mistake that the Blood King project, which I prepared in case you betrayed me, was completed so perfectly. Grid is too amazing. He can be my companion and rule hell with me.”’ </p><p>“...You missed the opportunity to die painlessly.” </p><p>Marie Rose had been deeply troubled after noticing her mother’s intentions.</p><p>The one who gave birth to her—naturally, Marie Rose couldn’t easily hate her, whom she loved. It was also hard for Marie Rose to resent her because she understood Beriache’s position. It might be a bit disgusting, but how about living together? </p><p>She really thought about it seriously. Yet at this moment, her worries were over. The moment Beriache mentioned Grid, Marie Rose’s affection and sympathy for her disappeared like a lie. </p><p>Let’s just kill her... </p><p>Wasn’t she dead anyway? </p><p>For the first time, the smile disappeared from Marie Rose’s face as she had been thinking crazily. </p><p>“”Yes, hate me.”” </p><p>If things had gone as planned, Marie Rose would’ve died without having time to feel betrayed. </p><p>It was sincere. </p><p>Beriache resented the whole situation. </p><p>Baal and Amoract, who drove her to give birth to Marie Rose; Grid, who killed Baal without Marie Rose’s help; Braham, who stood in her way and made her think more; and Noll, who rushed in with open arms and awakened the maternal love that she had suppressed. </p><p>Most of all, she resented herself. </p><p>She had to try and calm herself down. Beriache sighed deeply and recalled her duty. ‘I have a duty to protect the world my father created.’ </p><p>It was a duty that no one would understand. Therefore, she didn’t bother to say it. Beriache was determined to be remembered forever as the demon who had harmed and devoured her daughter out of personal greed. She might be criticized by everyone in the world, but she believed she had a duty to live for her father, who was betrayed by his other children. </p><p>It was said that it would inevitably be an act of betraying the child she gave birth to, but what could she do? Until she gave birth to Marie Rose, she never dreamed that she would feel sorry for Marie Rose. From the beginning, Marie Rose was just an existence born out of necessity. </p><p>Just then, Marie Rose’s right shoulder exploded. It was the result of Baal’s power, which she devoured using her power of ten thousand beings. </p><p>At the same time, Beriache’s waist was torn. It was the result of the wound caused by Braham being attacked. </p><p>The palace where Marie Rose had lived alone for many years—thanks to the long-awaited guests, the solitude that had been lifted was turned into a form of silence. Everything was ruined in a terrible way. </p><p>‘It isn’t good.’ </p><p>The longer the battle dragged on, the more haggard Marie Rose’s face became. In fact, she had felt it the moment she faced Beriache. It was the sense that the power and magic power she had accumulated in proportion to the passing years were rejecting her and turning toward her mother. </p><p>That’s right—she was weakening in real time. The weaker she became, the stronger Beriache became. As a being who was born for Beriache in the first place, Marie Rose’s existence itself worked to give beneficial results to Beriache. It was an inherent limitation. The compatibility was more than just terrible. </p><p>By the time she finally managed to get a hold of her dizzy mind, Marie Rose’s left hand was cut off. This was before her right shoulder, which had exploded earlier, had fully regenerated. </p><p>It was the moment when she couldn’t use both arms and the shadow of death came to her. </p><p>“Stop! It is up to here!” <nf6a94> Sᴇaʀᴄh thᴇ N0vᴇlFire(.)nᴇt website on Gøøglᴇ to access chapters of nøvels early and in the highest quality.</nf6a94></p><p>Someone came running. He stepped through the air several times with bizarre strides, closed the distance in an instant, and separated Beriache from Marie Rose. It was a man with a greatsword. </p><p>It was Chris. He didn’t even come alone. Eve, the apostle of the God of the Beginning, Yatan, accompanied him. The strongest forces, which had been absent from the hell expedition for some reason, grasped the situation and arrived at the scene one step earlier than Grid. </p><p>“Beriache...” Eve’s voice trembled. She seemed to sadly accept that the child of the god she served had fallen. </p><p>Beriache shrugged. “”Isn’t it better than Baal or Amoract?”” </p><p>At this point, the only opponent who could go against Beriache was Eve. Too much time had passed and there were too many beings who had disappeared over the years. </p><p>“”Sacrificing a child in exchange for protecting the world that Father made... I think it is a very cheap price.”” </p><p>In front of a being who had lived in the same era and had the same aspirations, Beriache finally revealed her purpose and couldn’t bear to make eye contact with Marie Rose. Additionally, the purpose she revealed acted as a powerful curse on Eve. </p><p>Beriache’s father was Yatan. The god that Eve served. Now that Eve discovered that Beriache was fighting to protect the world Yatan had created, she couldn’t stand in Beriache’s way. It wasn’t out of personal feelings. Of course, it also wasn’t a betrayal of Grid. It was more of an instinct. </p><p>“This...” Chris sighed as he noticed Eve’s immobility, as if she had been nailed down. At the same moment, Beriache’s hand pierced Marie Rose’s heart. </p><p>However, Marie Rose wasn’t dead. It was thanks to Noll, who had woken up at some point, rushed over, and wrapped himself around Marie Rose. He told the astonished Beriache with difficulty, “You told me... to cherish and love... my siblings...” </p><p>It was too powerful a blow. Before the power of regeneration could work, Noll turned to ash. He couldn’t go to the river of reincarnation. Instead, he was seized by the power of ten thousand beings and was sucked into Beriache’s soul. </p><p>“”...It is too late to regret it now.”” </p><p>The image of Marie Rose was projected on a teardrop falling from Beriache’s eyes. </p><p>Will you cry even when hurting me? </p><p>Such a questioning expression was reflected from various angles. </p><p>Blood gushed out again. It was the blood gushing from Marie Rose’s body. </p><p>***</p><p>After some time, when everything was over...</p><p>“......”</p><p>Grid came to the scene and witnessed Marie Rose sitting on the collapsed throne. Yes, she must be Marie Rose. Her appearance, presence, and even her body odor were the same as the Marie Rose that Grid knew. </p><p>However, Grid wasn’t relieved. Instead, his face contorted horribly as he pulled out and gripped Twilight. </p><p>The name written above Marie Rose’s head—the name that was repeatedly revealed and hidden by the swaying torchlight was Beriache, not Marie Rose. </p><p>“Why...?” </p><p>Why did this world keep bothering him? Now he just wanted to be comfortable. Thus, he had been working hard without a break. However, he was deprived of an important relationship again. </p><p>Grid exploded with killing intent as he recalled the day he first met Marie Rose, the moments he was helped by her, the memories of the bloody kiss, and the promise to marry her. A shockwave shook the palace. It was enough to cause Beriache to tremble despite taking Marie Rose’s body and becoming perfect. </p><p>“Certainly... you have completely transcended Baal.” Beriache rose slowly and spoke in Marie Rose’s voice. “Put away your sword and marry me.”</p><p>“Shut up.” </p><p>“If you kill me, you will never have a chance to bring Marie Rose back to life.” </p><p>“......?” </p><p>“Now I am Marie Rose. If we get married and have a girl, it is okay to name her Marie Rose...” </p><p>Beriache, who had been talking nonsense, suddenly closed her mouth. She suddenly raised both hands and grabbed her neck with enough force to break it. </p><p>“Kik... Wait, dear husband...” </p><p>A voice mingled between the groans that resembled ridicule—the whispered voice clearly belonged to Marie Rose. </p><p>Eve, who was still present at the scene with Chris and watched the situation, approached Grid. </p><p>“Maybe Beriache was the one who was eaten instead. This... she is a monster.” </p><p>“......” </p><p>Grid’s body trembled for various reasons.</p><p class="box-notification fs-17">Sᴇarch the <b>ɴøᴠel Fɪre.nᴇt</b> website on Gøøglᴇ to access chapters of nøvels early and in the highest quality.</p></div><h2>Chapter 1859</h2><div><p>Chapter 1858</p><p>Gradually, it became clear. </p><p>Her mother—from the beginning, Beriache gave birth to her in order to make this her own body. Her power that worked to Beriache’s advantage, contrary to her will, was the proof. Her body accepting Beriache’s soul without any resistance was also evidence. </p><p>“”I would be lying if I said I wasn’t sad. You will bitterly resent and hate me. But putting aside your feelings, I feel a deep affection for you. You, whom I gave my life to give birth to, you who look like me, you who have lived for me... I love you, my daughter.”” </p><p>Beriache’s soul permeated Marie Rose’s body while whispering eerily. She took for granted the body that had been born and nurtured for her from the beginning. </p><p>“......”</p><p>Her hands, legs, and mouth—once she finally realized that even her heart was beating for Beriache, not for herself, the vitality in Marie Rose’s eyes faded. In fact, the preparation of her mind was over. </p><p>Marie Rose realized that her resistance was meaningless from the time she noticed that the power and magic power she had accumulated over the years was working for Beriache’s advantage without harming her. A strong sense of destiny filled the air. Emotions that couldn’t be expressed as just desolation or loss made her infinitely helpless. </p><p>Let’s give up... </p><p>Suddenly, the sights that entered her vision were different from what she wanted to see. Marie Rose stopped struggling. She was unable to hold onto her fading spirit and offered ‘herself’ to Beriache. <nf20e1> Sᴇaʀch* Thᴇ N0vᴇlFire(.)nᴇt website on Gøøglᴇ to access chapters of nøvels early and in the highest quality.</nf20e1></p><p>“...Why?” </p><p>Then suddenly, she heard his voice. His voice trembled with all types of emotions. It caused her to remember the verses of the epic that she had savored while sitting alone in the dark palace. </p><p>[The God of the Surface stood up again.] </p><p>Baal, who had overcome countless deaths—he could’ve been frustrated by the infinite power of the king of hell, but he rose again at every moment without collapsing. </p><p>[The God of the Surface said there is no need to be afraid.] </p><p>Finally, Baal reverted to his primal form and became a giant. Even when the king of hell made the surface despair by showing a will to never fall down with a body larger than a mountain, he stood alone and calmly spoke. </p><p>[The God of the Surface cut off the source of fear. ] </p><p>Finally, he proved it—the power of an unbreakable will. </p><p>[I fought for you.] </p><p>The reason why his will wasn’t broken. He said it was for the people. </p><p>For the weak. To help them survive, he gritted his teeth and persevered. </p><p>Yes, he isn’t fighting for me. I am not an underdog. I’m not someone to be protected. </p><p>She thought so, but she was mistaken. His short words, stained with anger, sadness, and pain made her realize it. </p><p>‘You... you fought for me too.’ </p><p>The moment her thoughts went crazy, Marie Rose reached out. Her body had been taken away by Beriache and naturally didn’t respond. Marie Rose had reversed her position with Beriache. No, her situation was worse than Beriache’s a little while ago. Beriache was free to act in her soul state, while Marie Rose’s soul was trapped in her stolen body. </p><p>Marie Rose seized the will that had been broken after knowing the cruel reality and raised it up. She followed the will of the man who would be her companion. </p><p>Baal’s power—the powerful force contained in Beriache’s soul was gripped by Marie Rose’s soul. The same was true of Amoract’s power. The power that Marie Rose inherited from Beriache was at work. </p><p>The power of 10,000 beings—the power had been powerless against its source, Beriache, but it worked properly at this moment. It was only possible thanks to Marie Rose being swallowed up by Beriache. The power that had taken root inside Beriache was exposed to Marie Rose. </p><p>“If we get married and have a girl, it is okay to name her Marie Rose...” </p><p>In honor of her daughter who was about to disappear— </p><p>Beriache, who was talking nonsense with a different common sense from humans, closed her mouth. She noticed that Marie Rose’s soul, which had been fading inside her, was becoming incredibly powerful. </p><p>A chill went down her spine. The powers of Baal and Amoract that she had just taken from hell were getting out of control. They started to respond to Marie Rose’s soul, not hers. </p><p>What was going on? Beriache found what she had overlooked and hastily summoned her power. She struggled to grasp the powers of Baal and Amoract, which sought to free themselves from her. </p><p>It was meaningless. The reason why Marie Rose couldn’t beat Beriache was purely because of their compatibility. She was superior to Beriache in every way, and she was much more skillful at handling powers. From the point when Baal and Amoract’s powers were exposed to Marie Rose, they completely belonged to her. Even the power of the recently deceased Noll was like this. </p><p>‘Mother... we have to cherish and love each other.’ </p><p>Noll’s soul enveloped Beriache. He grabbed onto Beriache’s soul, which had already been deprived of strength and weakened, and didn’t let go. It wasn’t an attitude to hurt her. He simply had the will to be together. It was the power of compassion. It became a powerful poison. </p><p>Beriache’s soul, about to be extinguished, grabbed onto Noll’s soul. Against Beriache’s own will, she relied on the love of her child. </p><p>“Kik...” </p><p>Beriache was gradually feeling dizzy. Then she heard the noise filled with ridicule that was made by Marie Rose and suddenly came to her senses. </p><p>“Wait, dear husband.” </p><p>Beriache realized that Marie Rose didn’t even care about her. She realized that everything had already fallen apart. </p><p>“”No...! This can’t be! I have a duty to protect my father’s world...”” Beriache’s soul cried out desperately before closing her mouth. </p><p>A world dyed by the sunset—she was inside Marie Rose’s newly blossomed mental world and faced Marie Rose’s cold eyes. </p><p>“Yatan’s world is no more. It is already Grid’s world.” </p><p>An attitude toward filth—Marie Rose no longer respected Beriache. After informing Beriache of the cruel reality and plunging her into despair, Marie Rose turned her back on Beriache without any regret. She left Beriache behind in the world full of Grid’s divinity and her affection for Grid. </p><p>“”Marie Rose...!!”” </p><p>There was no escape. She would gradually fade and be swallowed up in Marie Rose’s ideal world... </p><p>Beriache’s scream of despair as she realized the punishment she would receive echoed meaninglessly. </p><p>Meanwhile, Marie Rose’s consciousness was focused solely on reality. </p><p>Lightly. </p><p>She jumped from her throne and stood in front of Grid. </p><p>A complete body—Marie Rose had swallowed all the powers of the Three Evils of the Beginning and cut off her natural destiny, so she was different from before. It wasn’t that her appearance had changed. She was still beautiful, but there was a warm and innocent smile added to it. </p><p>A face that was so beautiful that it didn’t look like a human being. It was a smile that washed away the rejection Grid felt. </p><p>‘...Really pretty.’ </p><p>Grid was limited to feeling just this sentiment. He forgot about the context and was fascinated by Marie Rose in front of him. </p><p>Marie Rose’s smile deepened. “Yes, it is a good attitude. Dear husband, you just need to look at and care about your precious things without any worries. That is enough.” </p><p>“Ah...” </p><p>It was strange. Grid was greatly comforted by this seemingly insignificant remark. He wondered about the reason. </p><p>During the hell expedition, Grid had faced a series of difficult and unexpected circumstances that were more than he had anticipated. Killing Baal, purifying hell, etcetera—he felt more fatigue than a sense of accomplishment in achieving his purpose.</p><p>The cause was the stress caused by all types of obstructions and things not going as planned. Of course, it would sound arrogant to others. Most people in the world were frustrated by repeated failures. In any case, it was difficult to understand from a general point of view why Grid would be dissatisfied after achieving his purpose. </p><p>However, Grid took a different position. The time, money, and effort he invested in preparing for this expedition went beyond the territory of ordinary. Grid didn’t prepare it alone. </p><p>To give a simple example. </p><p>Thousands of people invested in procuring materials to manufacture consumables such as buff potions for the expedition. Even that was only a small part of it. </p><p>Grid was the emperor. Executing his plan meant moving the Empire. The manpower that Lauel and the Overgeared Guild had been using over the past few months was in the hundreds of thousands. </p><p>Grid fought with their sweat and hard work, and the aspirations and destinies of many more people than him. He was in a position to disappoint and frustrate too many people if things went wrong. Therefore, he had no choice but to react sensitively to the slightest twists. He wasn’t happy despite all his achievements. </p><p>But at this moment, Marie Rose had declared it. </p><p>Don’t worry, don’t worry about anything. </p><p>It meant she would be there to help him take care of it even if he failed. He felt like he was relieved of the burden he had been carrying for so long. </p><p>Marie Rose—she was one of the few beings who could ‘completely’ support the present Grid. </p><p>“Let’s get married,” Grid said while grabbing Marie Rose’s hand. It was while giving her a desperate and affectionate look. </p><p>“Let’s get married without delaying any longer.” </p><p>“......”</p><p>The smile disappeared from Marie Rose’s face. Was this proposal not romantic enough? </p><p>It happened as Grid realized that he made a mistake because his heart got ahead of him... </p><p>“...Thank you.” Marie Rose’s eyelids fluttered and her stiff lips smiled again. It was a smile that was brighter than it had been before. “For needing me.” </p><p>A woman whose existence was almost lost to the woman who gave birth to her—a miracle happened when she, who had questioned the value of her own existence, realized many things through Grid and removed the shadows in her heart. </p><p>[Vampire Duke ‘Marie Rose’ has shown mercy to her brother.] </p><p>[Vampire Earl ‘Noll’ has been resurrected.] </p><p>The bones and flesh of vampires were different from that of humans. They were created through the medium of blood and their bodies were pure, red blood. Therefore, they had the power to scatter their body into mist. Marie Rose clearly transcended the progenitor, Beriache. It wasn’t difficult for her to resurrect Noll using his magic power and blood, which had been captured by the power of 10,000 beings. </p><p>“...Noll?” </p><p>Noll suddenly came alive and looked around. The boy, one of the few vampires Grid held dear, didn’t understand what was going on, but he came to his senses when he heard Grid’s voice. He roughly grasped the situation and his face turned red. “You... you saved my life, Gri...” </p><p>“What? You died?” </p><p>“...d.” </p><p>The deep emotion was broken. </p><p>Noll immediately made an expression like he was chewing on poop.</p><p class="box-notification fs-17">Sᴇarch the <b>n0vᴇl(ꜰ)ire.ɴet</b> website on Gøøglᴇ to access chapters of nøvels early and in the highest quality.</p></div><h2>Chapter 1860</h2><div><p>“I see...”</p><p>The reason for giving birth to Marie Rose.</p><p>How Noll died.</p><p>Grid’s expression was cold when he learned all about the atrocities committed by Beriache. He didn’t feel any sympathy or regret for her disappearance. He even blamed himself for trying to respect her as his mother-in-law when he met few a few hours ago.</p><p>However, Braham was on his mind. He was sure that Braham would be sad.</p><p>‘...But he will recover soon.’</p><p>Braham was the one who blocked Beriache’s path before anyone else. He held back his mother despite respecting and loving his mother, and resenting and hating Marie Rose. He was the first to notice that she was on the wrong path and denied her.</p><p>“By any chance, can you resurrect the other direct descendants?”</p><p>Grid was bothered by Noll’s dark expression and changed the subject.</p><p>The vampire earls Elfin Stone, Cray, Yetima, and Ruson; Marquis Fenrir; and the viscounts Tiramet and Latina—they had died and were attached to their respective artifacts. He wondered if they could also be completely resurrected like Noll.</p><p>“Of course. But it isn’t good for you, so let’s stop here.”</p><p>Marie Rose seemed to care that her immediate relatives had a bad relationship with Grid. She nodded that she could do it, but reacted negatively.</p><p>Grid didn’t really care about it.</p><p>“It is fine. They completed their education well...”</p><p>The bridge of the nose of the direct descendants was as high as Braham’s, but Grid was the exception. Now they shuddered and were humbled at the mere sight of Grid. Even if they were completely resurrected, it was unlikely that they would rebel against Grid again. There was no point even if they rebelled. It was because Noll and the other vampires wouldn’t sit back. Every vampire city in the world had long been Grid’s territory.</p><p>“Education?”</p><p>Noll tilted his head innocently.</p><p>Marie Rose spoke to Grid, who was stroking Noll’s head, “If you are trying to understand the moods of Noll and I, then there is no need. They are your property, dear husband. I don’t want to take them away from you. We will be satisfied if my dear husband keeps them by your side and uses them.”</p><p>Now Marie Rose didn’t hesitate to use the word ‘we.’ Today, she experienced loneliness and solitude through Beriache, and love and sacrifice through Grid and Noll. She felt many things. It awakened all types of emotions. She felt like she was human. Grid looked at the changed Marie Rose with satisfaction and shook his head.</p><p>“I can’t use them even if I want to. In the first place, they can’t help me at all.”</p><p>The direct descendant vampires—the enemies who brought a crisis to Grid in the past were different now. They were infinitely weak compared to Grid’s opponents and couldn’t help him train at all.</p><p>In a word, they were useless. It seemed much better to revive them so they could contribute to the development of the vampire cities. If they were respawned now, they would get the named NPC correction and overcome the Curse of Sloth.</p><p>The Curse of Sloth—the powerful curse that had been imprinted on the bloodline of the vampires and suppressed them was naturally extinguished as hell was purified.</p><p>“Yes, that makes sense.” Marie Rose nodded. She realized that there was no exaggeration in Grid’s frank words.</p><p>“I’ve experienced them myself. They were useless in life.”</p><p>“......”</p><p>The conversation between Grid and Marie Rose kept making Noll feel uneasy. He was finally turning to leave when he stopped.</p><p>“But if they are resurrected and live a life free of curses and obligations... I think it will be different from before.”</p><p>Freedom—it was a concept that none of the vampires had never enjoyed in their life, except for Braham. Looking back on it now, Braham had been blessed when he was banished from his clan.</p><p>“I also think the same.”</p><p>The Absolutes of the surface nodded and the direct descendant vampires were given a new destiny. Their consciousness that had been confined in the small space of the artifacts was pulled out into the world and given complete bodies. It was a miracle done with Marie Rose’s blood.</p><p>“This...”</p><p>The direct descendants immediately grasped the whole situation and were flustered. They had something in common. They hated or were jealous of Grid and Marie Rose. Yet they were revived due to the goodwill of these two existences.</p><p>Their feelings were complicated in many ways. There was an awkward silence for a while and it overshadowed Noll’s best efforts to be delighted.</p><p>Surprisingly, it was Elfin Stone who broke the silence some time later.</p><p>A being who hated the entire fate of his blood relatives after losing his lover to Braham—he had faced life with the most skeptical eyes among all his immediate family, but now he smiled, no matter how faint. It wasn’t a smile twisted with malice, but a comfortable and kind smile. It was the first time that his siblings, as well as Grid, had seen it.</p><p>“Thank you. Also... you’ve worked hard.”</p><p>Elfin Stone sent genuine respect and gratitude toward the opponent he had hated for a long time. It was the appearance of an elegant noble. His other siblings chose to imitate him.</p><p>All the direct descendants, including Fenrir, got down on one knee and bowed to Grid and Marie Rose. It wasn’t an act from succumbing to violence, but out of respect from the bottom of their heart. The death of their mother wasn’t a matter of importance to them. In the first place, their mother’s self-inflicted death was her own scheme and they had always longed for the future, not the past.</p><p>The evidence was that Braham was the only one who sought to avenge Beriache.</p><p>[Hell has been purified and the vampires who have overcome the curse are deeply grateful to you.]</p><p>[Your affinity with all the direct descendant vampires has risen to the maximum.]</p><p>[The speed of development and production for all vampire cities will increase significantly.]</p><p>[Prime Minister ‘Lauel’ has raised the tax rate of the vampire cities to 37%.]</p><p>‘What is Lauel’s reaction speed...?’</p><p>The purified hell was still exerting its influence in real time. It was like a gift package that hadn’t been fully unwrapped. It was going to give Grid more benefits in the future.</p><p>***</p><p>In the very distant past—at the height of the war between the Seven Good People and the gods. Fearing that the surface would be destroyed in the aftermath of the war, the giants sought to ascend to heaven. Their intention was to appease the wrath of the gods by presenting precious treasures. However, even the flying ships made by the giants couldn’t handle the heat of the sun. In the end, the giants couldn’t reach heaven.</p><p>At that time, the god who helped was King Daebyeol. The arrow shot by King Daebyeol hit the largest of the three suns and knocked it down. Thanks to this, the flying ship carrying the giants was able to ascend to heaven.</p><p>It was a myth that modern day humans didn’t know. This was a true story that Filewolf, a survivor of the giants, saw and experienced.</p><p>According to Filewolf, King Daebyeol was a very good god. He was the only one of the gods who didn’t ignore the crisis on the surface and helped humanity. The price was brutal. All the gods condemned and opposed King Daebyeol. They harmed him with one heart and one mind.</p><p>As a result, King Daebyeol lost his power, was exposed to Baal, and reduced to a mass of red flesh.</p><p>‘What a poor being.’</p><p>The myth of King Daebyeol had a bad ending in many ways. Not only did King Daebyeol himself meet a bad end, but the giants who ascended to heaven with the help of King Daebyeol angered the gods instead of appeasing them, and perished.</p><p>The Seven Good People—then the Seven Malignant Saints, were defeated and sealed in the war. Above all, King Daebyeol already had enemies in hell at that time. Therefore, he was weakened and exposed to Baal. In other words, he suffered throughout his life because he was born with a good heart, which was rare among the gods. Thus, even more—</p><p>“We have to stop him,” Zik affirmed from the front.</p><p>He looked more pained than the wounded King Daebyeol. King Daebyeol had no choice but to be special to Zik. He was a being who was of more help to his colleagues than himself, one of the Seven Malignant Saints.</p><p>Zik sincerely respected and felt sorry for him. Therefore, he thought that he shouldn’t stand by. If King Daebyeol went to the Hwan Kingdom or heaven like this, he would only suffer greater pain. In his weakened state, he would be mocked and die, rather than achieving revenge.</p><p>Mir’s thoughts were the same. As a native of the Hwan Kingdom, Mir also knew the myth of King Daebyeol. He stood beside Zik and pointed his sword at King Daebyeol with red eyes. It was while looking at the flowers that King Daebyeol’s divinity made bloom.</p><p>They were beautiful and fragrant nurturing grace flowers.</p><p>Mir learned that they were flowers made from the divinity of King Sobyeol.</p><p>He was taught that humans realized and respected the greatness of the gods thanks to King Sobyeol filling the ground with nurturing grace flowers.</p><p>Then King Sobyeol became disappointed with the incompetent and greedy nature of human beings and withered all the nurturing grace flowers from a certain day onward. Since then, humans forgot their respect for the gods and became even more ignorant.</p><p>Now that he saw it, everything was false. In the first place, the nurturing grace was a flower made by the divinity of King Daebyeol. The nurturing grace flowers on the surface disappeared because King Daebyeol fell to hell.</p><p>“Forget everything and be born again. You will always be great no matter how many times you are reborn. You will definitely be happy. I will surely find and take care of you, who have been reborn.”</p><p>He didn’t dare say that they would live together in the Overgeared World. The wounds inflicted on King Daebyeol’s body and mind weren’t at a level that could be easily healed. It was clear that he would never escape from the shadows of the past no matter how many beings, including Grid, comforted and soothed him. That was why he needed to start over.</p><p>“”I am too angry and bitter to leave like this...””</p><p>King Daebyeol only repeated the same words. He didn’t react no matter how much respect and favor Zik and Mir showed him. He was already blinded. He was only obsessed with the past. He was more like a soul than a god.</p><p>“Be careful of the pollen.” Biban gave advice in this solemn atmosphere.</p><p>The group responded immediately. They spread out in all directions away from the petals that were fluttering in the wind. The widely scattered petals and pollen became the things that connected the divinity of King Daebyeol. The divinity that flowed around King Daebyeol’s body took over the entire battlefield.</p><p>“This is already the domain of King Daebyeol. It is correct to interpret it as a physically embodied mental world.”</p><p>It was a horribly ruined mental world. King Daebyeol instinctively distanced himself from his mental world. It was because he didn’t know what type of monster would be born. Thus, he created a flower garden and built an area similar to a mental world in the middle of reality.</p><p>It was a ridiculous ability. The days when King Daebyeol was intact even though he had fallen to hell—it was understandable why ‘all the gods’ harmed him with one heart and one mind. Maybe they were wary because he was incredibly powerful.</p><p>“”First of all, I will see my little brother.””</p><p>King Daebyeol declared and released a huge amount of divinity. The flood of divinity shot in straight lines, diagonal lines, and curved lines toward the pollen and petals that filled the battlefield, dividing the battlefield into tens of thousands of areas.</p><p>“Kuek...!”</p><p>Kraugel groaned as he cut the approaching divinity with his sword. The burning pain from his hands was secondary. He witnessed the serious injuries of the Overgeared members who failed to avoid the divinity that flew in unpredictable directions and he became properly aware of the seriousness of the situation.</p><p>Strong...</p><p>It wasn’t at a level that the party, exhausted from repeated battles, could handle. Even the apostles could only protect themselves and Biban was still unable to fight. He was trying not to show it, but it was speculated that he was seriously injured.</p><p>‘I need to solve it.’</p><p>Kraugel felt an obligation. Unlike the rest of the group, he was the only one in an intact state because he had only fought Madra’s soul. He judged that he should make use of his relatively intact physical strength to face King Daebyeol.</p><p>‘No matter how strong, he is still short of his prime. He is just a soul body.’</p><p>Far from being an Absolute god, he was probably one level lower than Martial God Zeratul. There was no need to be too intimidated by this fraudulent ability to spread out his divinity widely and use it as a weapon...</p><p>Kraugel thought this far and immediately charged forward. He narrowed the distance to King Daebyeol and scattered a sword light. He tried to block the flood of divinity to allow the rest of the group to see an opportunity.</p><p>Blood gushed out. It was blood that poured from Kraugel’s body. The fight against a being that wouldn’t fall no matter how many times he was cut made Kraugel one-sidedly exhausted.</p><p>What was Grid thinking when he fought Baal?</p><p>It was the moment when Kraugel and Pagma, who were one, became solemn at the same time...</p><p>-Bend down!</p><p>Then he heard someone send him a whisper. The purified hell highlighted the players’ strengths.</p><p>Freedom of communication and freedom of movement.</p><p>Jishuka, who died and returned to the surface, returned with reinforcements. It was a tremendously large army. It was an alliance led by almost all of the members of the Overgeared Guild and the kings of the different species. There was also Ares’ army flying the flag of Valhalla.</p><p>“Protect the heroes!” Asmophel’s shout as he commanded the soldiers was heard. The former Red Knights also led the elites of the Overgeared Empire into war.</p><p>It was the final stage.</p><p>The Breaking Evil Arrow shot by Jishuka grazed by Kraugel’s ear and pierced King Daebyeol’s chest. King Daebyeol didn’t even flinch. He didn’t seem hurt at all. It was natural. In the first place, the Breaking Evil Arrow came from King Daebyeol’s divinity. The ‘unknown shrine’ where Jishuka obtained the Breaking Evil Arrow in the past was a shrine that served King Daebyeol in the distant past.</p><p>“”This...?””</p><p>Jishuka shouted to King Daebyeol, who was surprised to recognize the identity of the arrow in his chest, “King Daebyeol! There are still people who haven’t forgotten you and are serving you! I am one of them!”</p><p>“”......””</p><p>“We... we will surely get revenge for you...!”</p><p>It was before Jishuka’s cry was over.</p><p>The beautiful petals and pollen disappeared, leaving only the scent. The divinity that dominated the battlefield in the form of a spider’s web was almost lifted like it had been a lie.</p><p>“”Thank you. Thank you...””</p><p>He wasn’t forgotten. It brought great comfort to the great god, who had fallen to the ugliest form against his will. As it was, there was no way his revenge would succeed if he went to the Hwan Kingdom or heaven like this...</p><p>It was a strong hope for him, who knew this, but had no choice but to push himself.</p><p>“”Thank to you, I can close my eyes.””</p><p>King Daebyeol pulled the Breaking Evil Arrow from his chest and took out a huge bow. Even though he was an archer who shot down even the sun, he hadn’t taken out his bow until the end. This was the first time he took out a ‘real weapon.’ The Breaking Evil Arrow was placed on the bowstring pulled by King Daebyeol and fired at Jishuka.</p><p>“Eh? Huh?”</p><p>What? Didn’t he thank her?</p><p>The Breaking Evil Arrow penetrated the heart of the confused Jishuka.</p><p>“Jishuka!!”</p><p>It happened as her colleagues screamed out of shock from the development that was different from their expectations...</p><p>King Daebyeol shook off all his lingering feelings and jumped into the river of reincarnation.</p><p>rainbowturtle's Thoughts<nf992f> S~ᴇaʀᴄh the Nʘvᴇl(F)ire.nᴇt website on Gøøglᴇ to access chapters of nøvels early and in the highest quality.</nf992f></p><p>(2/4 weekly.)

It was the aftermath of Judar summoning the gods. </p><p>The God of Wisdom had been keeping an eye on the situation in hell. His eyes, which had been indifferent for many years, shone just as brightly as described by the myths of the distant past. </p><p>Dominion and the other chief gods also focused on the situation. </p><p>Hell was purified by Grid. Some of the beings to be liberated today were coveted talents from Asgard’s perspective. It was necessary to snatch their souls before they could cross the river of reincarnation. </p><p>“Now.” It happened the moment Judar gave the signal... </p><p>The 1st ranked Archangel, Raphael, formed branches out of light and wove a string. It was a string with a sharp needle at the end. </p><p>“You must not fail.” </p><p>A sight that one couldn’t imagine normally—Raphael, who was known for their disdain of the gods, replied in a very polite manner, “Yes.” </p><p>Of course, Raphael was bound to be humble in front of Dominion and Judar, but it was excessive today. The reason was simple: a bruised face that couldn’t be healed immediately even with the power of light. </p><p>Until they were rescued— </p><p>The 1st ranked Archangel had been imprisoned in the ‘Prison of Eternity’ until then and lost their momentum. Raphael had made quite a significant mistake. </p><p>Hexetia, the blacksmithing god, and the angel Khan, who was chosen to succeed him—the prisoners who were originally in prison were taken away by Grid while Raphael was imprisoned. It was even rumored that they were driven to the brink of death by Zeratul, who had lost his qualifications. </p><p>Now they were a sinner. It wouldn’t be strange if the qualification of an archangel was taken away from them at any time. </p><p>‘Shit.’ </p><p>At the murmurs of the gods, Raphael gritted their teeth and controlled their emotions. It was time to make up for it somehow. They stared silently at the well that illuminated the other side of hell and threw the fishing line woven with light. </p><p>The target was Baal. Surprisingly, Raphael planned to snatch the soul of the one killed by Grid and lift it to heaven. However, they failed. By the time the fishing line reached hell— </p><p>“......!”</p><p>Baal’s soul was scattered like dust. It didn’t head to the river of reincarnation and perished without a trace. </p><p>“He offered himself as a sacrifice to his self-made Evil God.” </p><p>What mistake did they make again? </p><p>As Raphael was feeling worried, Judar grasped the situation. Then he cast another look at Raphael. Raphael hastily moved. They broke the fishing line to catch even the remnants of Baal’s power. </p><p>It was too late. The soul of Beriache suddenly appeared and took Baal’s power. She also took the power of Amoract, who had died in a short time. </p><p>“That pea-sized thing...!” </p><p>Raphael wasn’t in perfect condition. Despite all their efforts to control their emotions, they quickly became agitated. They thought it would be really dangerous to fail like this and changed the target to be snatched to Beriache. Then suddenly— </p><p>“……”</p><p>Raphael made eye contact with Beriache. She seemed to have seen the fishing line made of light with her naked eyes. </p><p>The stunned Raphael quickly pulled the string away. </p><p>‘She truly is the child of Yatan.’ </p><p>The fishing line of light—by nature, it was impossible to be perceived by beings from a lower world. However, if they were the master of that world or the lineage of the master, it wouldn't be strange if they were capable of doing so. The fishing line could’ve been taken away... </p><p>Raphael got the chills and gasped roughly. Then someone sneered at them. </p><p>“You can’t seem to do anything right?” </p><p>It was Venice, the God of Money. The most unseemly one among all the gods—she was a merchant who lived by replacing the profits from buying and selling things with fame and divinity, and was originally a very insignificant existence for Raphael. Anything she said was nothing more than a dog barking to Raphael and she had never dared to say anything recklessly to Raphael. </p><p>Now really... the situation had changed. </p><p>Raphael clenched their fists and couldn’t even look at Venice. They were unable to raise their lowered head as they heard Judar talking to himself. </p><p>“In any case, Asura is one of the biggest targets, so it worked out well.” </p><p>Raphael followed Judar’s gaze. The gods and Raphael once again set their sights on the hell beyond the well. </p><p>The new Evil God, Asura—he was very strong. He had his own origin. In other words, it would be difficult to estimate how much stronger he would become if he joined with the red flesh. </p><p>“Can he be controlled?” </p><p>Would the exhausted Grid be able to handle Asura...? </p><p>Some gods had such doubts, but Dominion, the God of War, rightly predicted Asura’s defeat. </p><p>Judar cocked his head. </p><p>“Is there any reason to control him?” </p><p>At this moment, Raphael met Judar’s gaze for a moment and understood. All the freedom they had enjoyed so far—it wasn’t because they deserved it. It was just that Judar acquiesced. It was with an attitude that it wouldn’t affect the overall situation no matter how they rampaged. </p><p>‘This... shit...’ </p><p>They were just a dog in a fence. It happened as Raphael realized this and was overwhelmed with great shame... </p><p>“He is rising,” Judar said. </p><p>Asura was caught off guard by Grid’s bizarre angel who was ‘learning his skills intact’ and was severely cut by Biban. Now he was about to collapse. After a while, even his source, the red flesh, was destroyed by the Demon Slayer. Asura lost his power and meekly accepted death. </p><p>Out of his own will, he shot his soul toward the fishing line of light. It seemed that Judar had personally given him a divine message. </p><p>The new Evil God was taken. </p><p>The response of the gods to this fact was mixed. Some thought it was good that Asura would fill the void left by Zeratul, while others wondered if it was okay to bring an evil being into the realm of the Goddess. The former was obsessed with the defense of Asgard, while the latter was obsessed with the essence of Asgard. </p><p>It was all useless. Their responses weren’t opinions. </p><p>The moment Rebecca entered the cycle, all the decisions belonged to Judar and Dominion. However, it was rare for them to step forward, so only Raphael was active. </p><p>“Raphael.” </p><p>“Yes.” </p><p>“Above all, you must get your hands on King Daebyeol.” </p><p>King Daebyeol—as a child of Hanul, a God of the Beginning, he was in the same hierarchy as Judar and Dominion. Of course, in terms of hierarchy, the Three Evils of the Beginning and King Sobyeol were the same, but King Daebyeol was very special. </p><p>The gods of Asgard hadn’t forgotten. At the time when the Seven Malignant Saints dared to rebel—King Daebyeol’s power as he drew the bow to help them was truly outstanding. The largest sun made directly by the Goddess out of light fell. It was to the extent that Judar was alarmed. </p><p>At that moment, all the gods of heaven were of one heart and one mind. They united just to defeat King Daebyeol. Dominion even took the lead. </p><p>King Daebyeol was unable to withstand the onslaught of the gods. He fell into hell, was forgotten by many people, and was weakened. In the end, he suffered irreparable damage, fell into the hands of Baal, and turned into a mass of red flesh. </p><p>Judar was obsessed with his potential. If King Daebyeol obediently went through the process of reincarnation and resurrected, he would definitely one day be the poison of heaven. Therefore, Judar planned to summon him to heaven and make him a puppet. </p><p>“I think it is better to go down in person.” </p><p>Part of hell was incorporated into the Overgeared World, but it was only a part of it. </p><p>Dominion clutched his spear. He decided to directly capture King Daebyeol, who thankfully refused to reincarnate and fought with Grid’s subordinates. Judar thought about it for a moment and nodded. </p><p>Dominion was enveloped in a cluster of lights and disappeared from the scene. </p><p>In the gap where Grid was distracted by Beriache, he would secure King Daebyeol. The gods had no doubts about it.</p><p>“......” </p><p>However, Dominion didn’t appear in hell. </p><p>Judar immediately grasped the situation. “As expected... was he held back on the surface?” </p><p>In order to reach hell from heaven, they had to go through the surface. The delay in Dominion’s arrival meant he was stranded on the surface. But who would dare to interfere with Dominion? The surface was the realm of the Overgeared World, which greatly weakened Dominion, but it was impossible for a non-Grid level being to stand in Dominion’s way. </p><p>“Did the Old Dragons intervene...?” </p><p>The gods were agitated. It was unrealistic, but it was a reasonable guess. There was a situation recently where Gourmet Dragon Raiders helped Grid infiltrate heaven. </p><p>Judar’s thoughts were different. “It is Eve. She has been missing for a long time, but now she has come into contact with Grid.” </p><p>Yatan’s apostle—she was special among the apostles. It was due to Yatan’s nature. </p><p>Unlike Rebecca and Hanul, who created their own subjects, assigned roles, and left everything to them, Yatan personally found a human called Eve on the surface and nurtured her with affection. He taught her everything from beginning to end. She was a relatively difficult opponent for Dominion to immediately subdue when he was weakened by the oppression of the Overgeared World. </p><p>“Raphael, you have to do it.” </p><p>“...Yes.” Raphael’s hand on the fishing rod tightened. It was because they felt they would be shaking if they didn’t give more strength to it. Raphael had a hunch that this was their last chance. </p><p>King Daebyeol, who was isolated among Grid’s subordinates—if Raphael didn’t take the opportunity to snatch his soul, Judar wouldn’t give them a second chance...</p><p>‘Shit, how do I do this?’ </p><p>Raphael lamented to themselves, gulped, and focused all their senses on King Daebyeol. </p><p>Then... </p><p>“...It’s done!” </p><p>In the end, Raphael succeeded in snatching King Daebyeol’s soul. It was really a tiny difference. The soul of King Daebyeol was raised just before he fell into the river of reincarnation. </p><p>“I...! I did it!” </p><p>How long had it been since Raphael felt such joy? Today, Raphael was swept away by all types of emotions, unlike an Absolute, and finally reached the point of cheering. </p><p>“It is useless,” Judar spat out coldly. </p><p>At the same time, Raphael also noticed it. </p><p>The soul of King Daebyeol that he tried so hard to catch—it was empty. It was a shell without even the slightest bit of divine power left. If he was reincarnated, he might be able to recover some of his divine power. Even so, it wouldn’t mean much and it was completely useless in the current state. </p><p>Judar’s eyes fell on the human woman who had just been the target of the arrow shot by King Daebyeol. </p><p>“Raphael, I’ll give you a chance to make up for it.” </p><p>***</p><p>“Jishuka!” </p><p>“Jishuka!” </p><p>Jishuka was the founder of the Tzedakah Guild, which was the predecessor of the Overgeared Guild. Many of the people who still reigned as the strongest force of the Overgeared Guild were talents recruited by her in the past. Her symbolism was great. After Grid and Lauel, Jishuka was the one that the Overgeared members trusted and relied on the most. </p><p>There were many people who were agitated by the sight of her dying again after saving her colleagues from danger. </p><p>Yura and Kraugel came running instantly. It was to somehow prevent the death of Jishuka, who was properly hit by the arrow shot by the soul of King Daebyeol. </p><p>Yura opened the lid of the potion she had and poured it on Jishuka. In the meantime, Kraugel managed to find and grab Ruby and made a puzzled expression. “Is it impossible to even resurrect her?” </p><p>Jishuka had been killed by Asura just a few hours earlier. It meant that her immortality was on cooldown. Once he saw that she didn’t open her eyes, he was sure she was dead. It was right to resurrect her before she turned to ash. </p><p>Additionally, one of Ruby’s ultimate skills was a resurrection skill. However, she stayed still and didn’t use her skill. </p><p>It was a time when they succeeded in purifying hell and should be enjoying the festive atmosphere. Jishuka suffered two deaths in a row and experienced a huge loss alone. She was even forced to log out and watch the celebration from afar. </p><p>It happened as everyone was feeling disappointed... </p><p>“Cough cough cough! Stop!” Jishuka sprang up. She spat out the potion that had gone into her nose and mouth. </p><p>Ruby belatedly explained to the dumbfounded group, “She isn’t dead. Rather, she is fine.” </p><p>“......?” <nf739b> Sᴇaʀch* Thᴇ n0vᴇl(ꜰ)ire.ɴet website on Gøøglᴇ to access chapters of nøvels early and in the highest quality.</nf739b></p><p>The eyes of the group slowly widened. They realized the subtle scent of flowers that was spreading along with Jishuka’s breaths. It was the scent of the nurturing grace flowers. </p><p>The handful of divinity left by King Daebyeol was inherited by Jishuka.</p><p class="box-notification fs-17">Sᴇarch the <b>Nʘvᴇl(F)ire.nᴇt</b> website on Gøøglᴇ to access chapters of nøvels early and in the highest quality.</p></div><h2>Chapter 1862</h2><div><p>It was almost a disaster—that was the overall assessment of those who watched Grid’s hell expedition. This expedition didn’t end even when Baal was killed. Instead, incidents repeatedly occurred. If Grid had failed, people would’ve complained to the S.A Group and said that it was a really terrible game.</p><p>This damn thing. What type of nonsense was it that the situation didn’t end after defeating the final boss, and one crisis after another kept popping up?</p><p>They were nervous even from the position of those cheering. It scared them. Then how were the feelings of the parties involved?</p><p>“What is the point of protesting as a group? They won’t quit the game anyway. Isn’t that right?”</p><p>“There is no alternative.”</p><p>“That is the scary thing about Satisfy. If it wasn’t for Grid, the users would always be at odds with the company.”</p><p>Reinhardt, the capital of the Overgeared Empire, and in addition, the super-large airship floating above Reinhardt, the Tomb of the Gods—a grand festival was held in the ‘greatest city on the surface’ and the ‘greatest city in the sky,’ which were located next to each other on the ground and in the sky.</p><p>A festival was held to celebrate a successful expedition. It far exceeded the scale of the self-celebration of the Overgeared Guild. It wasn’t an exaggeration to say that people came from all over the world. The crowds gathered at Reinhardt and the Tomb of the Gods was staggering.</p><p>It was truly unprecedented. It was also a festival of a scale that would never be seen in the future.</p><p>The reporters from third-rate news organizations around the world watched the crowds enjoying the festivities without any worries and were convinced—in this atmosphere, if they wrote malicious articles against Grid and the Overgeared Guild, they were bound to be terrorized by someone.</p><p>At this time, it was right to abandon their rigid work ethic...</p><p>A truly surprising thing happened when the third-rate reporters, who originally made their living by writing ‘rumors without any accurate evidence’ or ‘articles avoiding responsibility when rumors were false,’ didn’t write recklessly. It was a great unification of the media that transcended borders, races, and ideologies.</p><p>From all over the world, there were only articles favoring Grid and the Overgeared Guild. This was something that no great person or group in the history of humanity had achieved.</p><p>Of course, the resulting backlash occurred. Was it because of the sense of crisis that they might lose their livelihood? The third-rate and tabloid media from all over the world targeted the S.A Group and relentlessly bit at them. If it wasn’t for Grid and the Overgeared Guild, who would’ve defeated Baal and the hidden bosses one after another, and purified hell? They criticized the S.A Group and Chairman Lim Cheolho for being hypocrites. Chairman Lim Cheolho repeatedly stated that he wanted Satisfy to be the hope of the people, but Satisfy’s ending was actually set as a bad ending.</p><p>“I feel better.”</p><p>Peak Sword laughed. Most of the members of the Overgeared Guild responded the same. In fact, they were the ones who wanted to blame the S.A Group the most. It was especially so when they saw the development of ‘Baal’s death gave birth to Asura.’ It was really... many people uttered curse words that they had never spoken in their lifetime. Then the third-rate media outlets, which were usually hated, started to target the same object of hatred and were rampaging wildly.</p><p>“It is completely letting the barbarians fight among themselves,” Hao said as he smiled slightly and tilted his glass. He was still wearing a gold mask.</p><p>Ibellin asked carefully, “The mask... why are you using it?”</p><p>The reason why Regas was wearing a mask was revealed.</p><p>At the time of the Asura raid—Regas, who hadn’t been able to grow up due to the Asura class, made explosive progress by replicating Asura’s skills in real time. It was a relief after being suppressed for several years.</p><p>Yes, the reason for wearing a mask was quite convincing. If Asura had recognized Regas’ face and was wary, Regas wouldn’t have been able to replicate Asura’s skills and wouldn’t have been able to help Biban in any way. Regas needed to hide his identity.</p><p>On the other hand, what about Hao? The reason why he had to wear a mask was still a question...</p><p>“Look at the attitude of these media outlets right now. If it is revealed that Hao is working with us, there will be a lot of uproar in China,” Regas explained on behalf of Hao, who laughed bitterly.</p><p>“Ah.”</p><p>It made sense right away. Hao became a traitor to China just because he admitted defeat to Grid in the National Competition. He had been criticized so much and for too long that he couldn’t handle it. His desire to hide his identity was understandable.</p><p>“It almost seems like the object they will criticize will become Hao, not the S.A Group. It is very difficult to be famous.”</p><p>Ibellin himself was a celebrity. It meant Ibellin had suffered tremendously from the third-rate media outlets that were now biting at the S.A Group like the group was their parents’ enemies. In other words, he could fully understand Hao’s position.</p><p>“I think that Grid is really great in that sense.”</p><p>Hao laughed.</p><p>The success of the hell expedition—it was right after accomplishing the tremendous feat of saving humanity. To put it bluntly, the eyes of all of humanity were focused on Grid. Besides, it was now the time of the festival with the provocative promotional phrase ’Overgeared Guild’s Treat.’</p><p>During the festival, visitors to Reinhardt and the Tomb of the Gods could enjoy unlimited food and drinks for ‘free.’</p><p>According to Lauel’s calculations, it was still a surplus business. No, it was a ‘business that will make more money.’ Thanks to the promotional slogan of unlimited food and drinks, even those with heavy buttocks came to the festival.</p><p>Additionally, as the best city in Satisfy, Reinhardt sold all types of rare things. To add a bit of exaggeration, the quality of the stalls in a corner of Reinhardt’s smallest market was comparable to the quality of the goods stocked by the most famous stores in small and medium-sized cities. This meant that visitors had no choice but to open their wallets.</p><p>Additionally, there was a huge number of demonkin among the tourists for this festival. They had regained their freedom after being trapped in the safe zones all their lives and came to the surface for the first time. From their perspective, the ordinary items sold by Reinhardt were rare treasures that they had never seen in their lifetime. It was natural to imagine Administrator Rabbit crying out of happiness.</p><p>In any case, in this place where so many people were visiting—</p><p>Today, Grid would hold a surprise wedding ceremony. This was given that Grid was often criticized by people for only one reason: his experience with women. It was a very bold decision...</p><p>“It will be an opportunity for some of the media and public opinion to turn against Grid when it is currently unconditionally favorable to him.”</p><p>Currently, Grid had three wives. Of course, it was a common situation for players who had obtained a decent title to be to married multiple men or women. The problem was that Grid also had two lovers in real life.</p><p>Gaining a new wife in this situation? The media currently biting at the S.A Group would turn their attention to Grid. Grid clearly knew this fact, but he said he would definitely get married this time. He said he wanted to be blessed by more people.</p><p>At this point, it meant that Grid wasn’t afraid of the press at all. It was because he received the most attention in the world and must’ve suffered from the media more than anyone else.</p><p>For Hao and Ibellin, it was a strong heart that they really wanted to emulate. No, it was closer to being incomprehensible.</p><p>Then Lauel poked his head out from among the Overgeared members worrying about the criticism that Grid would face.</p><p>“In fact, it must be now.”</p><p>The emperor’s wedding ceremony was about to take place, so he was currently dressed in splendid formal attire.</p><p>“It is a wedding ceremony that needs to be held anyway. There will be less backlash if it is done when public opinion is good.”</p><p>Lauel looked at Grid’s marriage from a political perspective. He thought that Marie Rose’s strength was essential for Grid. It was after all the events had come to an end.</p><p>In fact, he felt sorry for Grid, who said he was going to marry Marie Rose quickly. It was because he witnessed several times what Marie Rose was like. Marie Rose’s evil appearance as she bit Grid’s lips and licked his blood under the guise of a kiss... Lauel would never forget it.</p><p>It was the same for Huroi. ‘My poor liege...’</p><p>What type of threats did he receive that he was in such a hurry to get married? It was already sad to think that he would be tormented for the rest of his life by the monstrous woman who laughed at the Old Dragons. He was on the verge of tears.</p><p>At a time when everyone was worried about Grid for various reasons...</p><p>“It is nice to see you.”</p><p>“Hello.”</p><p>“......”</p><p>Grid was scared for a slightly different reason.</p><p>It was the moment when he was introducing Irene to his new life. It was already the third time, but he always felt like he was sitting on a cushion of thorns. Furthermore, this time the other person was an Absolute. In fact, he was more afraid of Marie Rose’s inner thoughts than Irene’s. He wondered if she would harm Irene. He was worried and nervous.</p><p>Did she know Grid’s heart or not?</p><p>Irene spoke with a loving smile as always, “Vampire duke, Marie Rose. I know your noble self well. You have a great reputation. I know that you are a rare Absolute in the world and that you are much older than me. It is right if I serve you wholeheartedly.”</p><p>“You know it well.”</p><p>Your noble self...?</p><p>Marie Rose cocked her head at the unexpected title before slowly smiling deeply.</p><p>Her dear husband’s legal wife—she was the first woman her dear husband fell in love with and also gave birth to his child. Marie Rose was going to be respectful to a certain extent. Of course, when she said respect, it meant to guarantee the state of the legal wife and to say some good things.</p><p>Marie Rose looked at it realistically. Irene was just a god’s companion and was nothing compared to her, an Absolute. The hierarchy of the two of them could be called the difference between heaven and earth. There would be few such face-to-face meetings in the future.</p><p>It happened as she was thinking this...</p><p>“However, since His Majesty has welcomed you as his imperial concubine, I won’t be able to serve you. I am afraid and nervous because my rank is higher than yours, but I will be brave and behave properly. I hope we get along in the future.”</p><p>“......?”</p><p>Marie Rose doubted her ears but she couldn’t react hastily. She didn’t feel any ill will from Irene. It was a truth conveyed by the senses of an Absolute. Irene wasn’t being territorial right now. She didn’t despise Marie Rose, nor was she jealous. It was just that as Grid’s legal wife, the empress of the Empire and the mother of the people, she was aware of herself and behaved properly. As she said, she was squeezing out her courage.</p><p>‘...She was originally just a noble of a small kingdom.’</p><p>Marie Rose saw Irene’s determined eyes and calculated her position.</p><p>Irene—her lineage was inferior to Mercedes, a nobleman and chief knight of the Saharan Empire. She also wasn’t comparable to Basara, who was an empress. However, her identity had changed continuously since her marriage to Grid.</p><p>From a duchess to a king’s wife, to an emperor’s wife, and then a god’s wife. She was served in reverse by those she deserved to bow her head to.</p><p>Was she happy? Judging from her feelings, she must be more burdened than happy. Even so, she never showed it. She might be very nervous in this moment, but the way her fingertips didn’t even tremble showed how much effort she had put in.</p><p>“I like it.”</p><p>After Irene’s series of remarks, Marie Rose silently finished weighing the situation and spoke slowly, “Empress Irene, I know your heart. Don’t worry, I’ll make sure to behave appropriately. Ah, in addition.”</p><p>It was a gentler attitude than expected. Grid was relieved to see Marie Rose speaking unexpectedly softly, only to be nervous again.</p><p>Maybe she was going to add that Irene should be careful with her mouth from now on... he had such concerns. It was a guess because he didn’t know much about Marie Rose yet.</p><p>“I hope we get along in the future as well.”</p><p>The gentle smile she only showed to Grid up until yesterday—Marie Rose had a smile on her face that was captivating to both sexes as she whispered to Irene, “I’ll take good care of you as well as Grid.”</p><p>Irene, who almost called out ‘Older Sister,’ hurriedly covered her mouth and nodded. After a while—</p><p>“What? Grid is getting married again?”</p><p>The surprise announcement of the promotional officer, Huroi, turned Reinhardt upside down. No, it was more accurate to say that the whole world was in an uproar.</p><p>The reporters rushed in.</p><p>“Is it even a public wedding ceremony?”<nfc49d> Sᴇaʀᴄh thᴇ N0ᴠᴇFɪre.nᴇt website on Gøøglᴇ to access chapters of nøvels early and in the highest quality.</nfc49d></p><p>They pointed out Grid’s attitude of opening the wedding venue to the public.</p><p>“It is an attitude that shows he really isn’t worried about anything.”</p><p>“I agree. Later, he will brag about having 3,000 court ladies.”</p><p>He wasn’t ashamed of his experience with women but was showing it off. This might be Satisfy and he might be the hero who saved the world, but this was going too far. Of course, the residents of Satisfy would praise it, but it was hard to accept from the perspective of modern people.</p><p>Reporters were preparing to use this opportunity to pour out provocative articles when they suddenly stiffened like stone statues.</p><p>It was the moment when a woman wearing transparent cotton cloth appeared in the hall. It was a woman whose skin felt whiter than the pure white dress.</p><p>The identity of the woman staring at Grid with red jade-like eyes was none other than Marie Rose.</p><p>She was the bride.</p><p>The gestures of Huroi and the knights as they saluted and shouted for the bride’s entrance were conveying it in real time.</p><p>“……”</p><p>All the guests were fascinated by Marie Rose’s elegant appearance and only the sound of pens scratching rang through the silent wedding hall. It was the sound of slashing. It was as if the reporters were erasing something.</p><p>Breaking news soon poured out.</p><p>[The reasons why we can’t help celebrating Grid’s marriage.]</p><p>[The bride is too beautiful to criticize Grid.]</p><p>[This marriage is recognized.]</p><p>There was a phrase that people often used to describe Marie Rose—she was the embodiment of the ideal type of all humans.</p><p>The reporters couldn’t criticize Grid. They unconditionally sympathized, respected, and acknowledged Grid’s choice. It was inevitable as a human being. If they criticized Grid under the current circumstances, they would just be treated as fools who were jealous of Grid.</p><p>Thanks to this, Grid’s wedding was held in a peaceful and blessed manner.</p><p>rainbowturtle's Thoughts</p><p>(4/4 weekly.)

There was a significant increase in the level of the Overgeared World, which had expanded its territory to hell. He secured the core of the beginning that could make any wish come true, and Bunhelier’s loyalty (?).</p><p>The acquisition of Pagma’s Sword Dance, etc. </p><p>This was putting aside the fact that the dead had been put to rest and humanity had overcome its fears. </p><p>The hell expedition brought huge rewards to Grid. There was no other way since it was a reward for a near-final ordeal. </p><p>The redistribution of stats would be a formidable variable for enemies fighting against Grid in the future. Due to the ability to change it in real time, it was theoretically impossible to properly assess Grid’s power. </p><p>The increase in the level of the Overgeared World allowed him to appoint more angels. </p><p>The influence of the human gods belonging to the Overgeared World had increased. This also increased the probability of beneficial effects for humans. </p><p>The core of the beginning and Bunhelier were reliable insurances. </p><p>If— </p><p>If Grid did experience a crisis, then they could be relied on. </p><p>Grid was particularly fascinated by the power of Baal and Amoract. </p><p>[Demon Sword Remnants] </p><p>[A remnant of the power left by the 1st Great Demon, Baal. </p><p>After entering a state of combat, the form of Baal’s favorite demon sword will emerge and assist you.] </p><p>[Deception, Confusion, Temptation] </p><p>[A remnant of the power left by the 2nd Great Demon, Amoract. </p><p>Any target hostile to you won’t properly recognize your health gauge (or wounds).] </p><p>It was before Beriache took the powers of Baal and Amoract—Grid gained their powers first. Of course, it was only a fraction of it. Just as has been the case for a long time, he had been hampered by the setting that the capacity of the Rune of Gluttony was insufficient. The system explained that the hierarchy of Baal and Amoract was too high to fully absorb their power. </p><p>Even so, he was thankful. There were many cases where he wasn’t able to gain any powers at all. It was meaningful that he gained a small amount of the powers of the 1st Great Demon and the 2nd Great Demon. </p><p>Of course, he didn’t have high expectations. It was comforting that it wasn’t on the level of dog fur. Then when he checked later, he realized it wasn’t just that much. The power of Baal and Amoract far exceeded Grid’s expectations. </p><p>First of all, both skills were passive. It didn’t require any resources or conditions. It was triggered spontaneously without Grid being conscious of it and controlling it. Nevertheless, the effect was very interesting. </p><p>First of all, Demon Sword Remnants—it was a skill that was activated in a ‘combat state.’ It was very compatible with the senses of an Absolute. The moment something antagonized Grid, it immediately floated up and intercepted it. To put it more precisely, the skill reacted before Grid could identify the enemy. </p><p>It was similar to the artificial senses, but the artificial senses had to be consciously unfolded by Grid. This meant that Demon Sword Remnants was much more convenient. In the first place, the attack coefficient was so high that the God Hands couldn’t be compared to it. </p><p>In any case, the reason to keep his nerves sharp at all times had disappeared. It might not seem like a big deal, but it was a huge difference. Grid usually had to stay focused because he didn’t know when an enemy who was an Absolute would threaten him. Now he found peace in the true sense of the word. Finally, he was able to live a normal life just like everyone else. </p><p>Next up was Amoract’s Power. </p><p>Deception, Confusion, Temptation—this skill was also simple in principle, but it had a great effect. It was a passive skill that caused confusion over his ‘current state’ with a hostile target. It was bound to be useful. If a player was hostile to Grid, then they would be mistaken about Grid’s health gauge. They might misunderstand high health as low health or vice versa. </p><p>The same applied to NPCs and monsters. The other person would be confused and make misjudgments, such as recognizing a dying Grid as being in a normal state, or Grid without any wounds as dying. </p><p>‘I should’ve received these skills from the beginning.’</p><p>They were simple and convenient, but powerful skills. There was no cooldown time or resource consumption. They were skills that the old Grid longed for. It was a shame that he got them so late. </p><p>‘...No, in the first place, it is too fraudulent. That is why I only got it now.’ </p><p>They were skills dropped by the 1st Great Demon and the 2nd Great Demon. It was too unconscionable to feel regret about not having acquired such skills from the beginning. </p><p>Grid soothed himself and slowly raised his head. </p><p>A military band was performing to announce Marie Rose’s position. </p><p>The entrance to the wedding hall—the most beautiful woman in the world, and one of the few beings Grid could rely on, entered. She was greeted by her siblings, who had their lives restored. Of course, Braham wasn’t among them. </p><p>Braham... </p><p>“What is so pretty about her?” </p><p>He was sitting in the guest seats with the other apostles. He was deeply displeased with the reaction that people showed when Marie Rose appeared. </p><p>“I would be a few levels above Marie Rose if I was born a woman.” </p><p>It was Braham who added an assumption that Grid didn’t want to imagine. Even so, Grid thanked him very deeply. If it wasn’t enough that he interfered with the mother he loved and respected most in the world for Grid’s sake, he also didn’t resent Marie Rose for hurting their mother. His attitude toward Marie Rose was just as chilly as before, but the evidence was that he obediently participated as a guest. </p><p>Maybe Braham— </p><p>Maybe he felt sorry for Marie Rose from the moment he found out what Beriache was trying to obtain through Marie Rose. It might’ve been a reminder of their sibling relationship that had been ignored. </p><p>‘Maybe one day they can get along...’</p><p>...No, it probably wouldn’t end up like that? </p><p>Slowly and with an elegant gait—Marie Rose approached Grid, who coughed in vain as he watched Braham glare at Marie Rose with a killing intent that went beyond hostility. </p><p>“Wow...” </p><p>The guests were half-mesmerized. </p><p>Beings who crossed species, tribes, and borders—all the guests who gathered to celebrate Grid today were mesmerized by Marie Rose, regardless of anything. </p><p>Lauel had said it jokingly. If it wasn’t for Grid and Marie Rose’s overwhelming power and authority, the Empire might’ve been ruined by those who were fascinated by Marie Rose’s beauty. There must’ve been people who rebelled in order to get Marie Rose. It wasn’t an exaggeration. When it came to expressing Marie Roe’s beauty, the term ‘peerless beauty’ wasn’t sufficient. </p><p>“Wow. I’m discouraged.” Even the always confident Jishuka muttered such words. </p><p>Mercedes even put on makeup. Just like a knight among knights, she wasn’t interested in embellishments at all, but she felt a sense of crisis from Marie Rose. </p><p>They all looked pretty to Grid. </p><p>No, the same was true in the eyes of other people. </p><p>Irene, Yura, Jishuka, Mercedes, and Basara—all of them were beautiful to the point where they could be described as peerless beauties. Why did all these women, each with their own charms, fall in love with Grid? The jealousy that had been forgotten for a while was renewed and people started to glare at Grid. </p><p>Then one by one, they controlled their emotions. It was the aftermath of seeing Grid greet his bride with a big smile. Unlike on the battlefield, Grid in his formal clothes was objectively cool. He looked as brilliant as his achievements so far. </p><p>In a way, it wasn’t something to be jealous of. They even thought it was fortunate that it was Grid, not another ugly man, who had a relationship with them. <nff693> Sᴇaʀᴄh the N0ᴠᴇFɪre.nᴇt website on Gøøglᴇ to access chapters of nøvels early and in the highest quality.</nff693></p><p>“The next procedure...” </p><p>The atmosphere was completely calm. Huroi’s voice rang out after the ceremony filled with pure goodwill and blessings. The world stars Laella and Nyangmong sang a congratulatory song, and Piaro gave a congratulatory speech. </p><p>Why was the marriage arranged in such a hurry? </p><p>The somewhat puzzled members of the Overgeared Guild slowly realized the reason. </p><p>The day the world was saved—they witnessed several times the sight of the people, who were happy but somewhat anxious and confused, become relieved after seeing the faces of the heroes who came as guests. </p><p>We are always by your side... </p><p>Maybe Grid wanted to tell the people this. </p><p>“He was using his own marriage as a tool to reassure people. That is how deep God Grid is.” </p><p>The impressed Peak Sword even had red eyes. He didn’t forget to ask the reporters who were usually close to him to make good use of Grid’s inner thoughts when writing their articles. </p><p>Finally, Grid and Marie Rose swore eternal love and kissed. There was thunderous applause. All of those cheering truly blessed Grid and Marie Rose’s future. </p><p>‘...I’m happy.’ </p><p>A kiss without pain—Grid felt the soft texture of Marie Rose’s lips, not the metallic taste of blood, and trembled with joy. Marie Rose was trembling in a different sense. </p><p>A lofty Absolute in the world had shaking eyelashes and was rarely trembling—it was due to Grid’s hands wrapped around her waist and against her cheek. It was like... </p><p>A sensation she had never known before rose from the depths of her body. It was truly an unfamiliar and terrifying sensation. Her mind turned blank and she almost lost strength in her legs. She vowed to Irene that she would behave well, but she almost showed an indecent appearance in front of people. </p><p>“...Marie Rose?” </p><p>Marie Rose’s reaction as she subtly lost her breath made Grid feel puzzled. Could it be that she was suffering from her vampire instincts? </p><p>Grid was feeling anxious at the thought of his lips possibly being bitten again. Then Marie Rose leaned her forehead against his chest and whispered, “I’m afraid of tonight.” </p><p>“......??” </p><p>***</p><p>Grid held a grand festival and neglected surveillance on the surface. It was an opportunity for the 1st ranked Great Archangel, Raphael. They came down to the surface secretly and moved to hell. </p><p>Hell—a large portion of it was incorporated into the Overgeared World, but the situation was different compared to the surface. Remnants of distortion remained and some areas were just as unstable as they were when Baal was alive. It was surprisingly easy to find demons and demonic creatures who were still stained with malice. </p><p>Raphael searched for the wandering great demons. </p><p>Pure white wings and a halo of light—they searched for gloomy spaces that didn’t match the appearance of a holy angel. Finally, they found it. </p><p>Vicious demons biting at each other like beasts. </p><p>“Beasts who have lost your master. I will give you some help.” </p><p>“...Thank you so much?” </p><p>The great demons who were preying on other great demons—the girls who looked exactly like twins welcomed Raphael with a smile. </p><p>‘It is going well from the start.’ </p><p>Raphael also smiled.</p><p class="box-notification fs-17">Sᴇarch the <b>NƟvelFɪre.ɴet</b> website on Gøøglᴇ to access chapters of nøvels early and in the highest quality.</p></div><h2>Chapter 1864</h2><div><p>Chapter 1863</p><p>The Overgeared Empire was different from the Saharan Empire. The will of the Empire wasn’t imposed on other nations. From the perspective of other nations, there was no reason to disobey. </p><p>In the first place, they shouldn’t disobey. It was because every kingdom on the continent was economically dependent on the Empire. </p><p>At some point, they came to their senses and this was what happened. It was the result that Lauel created. Lauel shackled the other kingdoms with money and power, not force. It was covertly and tenaciously. It was designed so that they couldn’t disobey the Empire even if the sky collapsed. </p><p>It wasn’t strange to incur other people’s grudges. In particular, it was normal for the royalty of other kingdoms to not see Lauel in a good light. </p><p>However, this wasn’t a normal situation. All the royal families in the world served Grid. They offered up tributes of their own will. They gave unconditional favor and support that was beyond the level of not disobeying the Empire. They were even grateful to Lauel. </p><p>“Prime Minister Lauel. Thank you for making my kingdom dependent on the Empire. Thanks to you, I can happily serve the Empire to my heart’s content without any backlash from anyone.” </p><p>In fact, there were many kings who secretly greeted him in this way. </p><p>“......”</p><p>At the banquet hall after the grand wedding... </p><p>Lauel, who had strengthened his escort because there were so too many places to stab him, made a strange and complicated expression. </p><p>Oh my god. There was actually a time when he received thanks, not complaints. </p><p>The impact of Grid was realized. It was very touching that all of humanity loved and respected Grid. </p><p>‘I’m happy and proud, but it is awkward.’ </p><p>To be exact, it was embarrassing. The goodwill of the people made him feel guilty. It was an emotion he didn’t feel even when he buried tens of thousands of enemy prisoners who surrendered and abandoned their weapons. </p><p>Basara, who was watching Lauel gradually increase the speed at which he drank from the glass, cautiously said, “I think it would be good if you can relax a bit in the future.” </p><p>Be generous—she didn’t dare use such words. She didn’t want to look like she was blaming Lauel. </p><p>Basara had a personality that was the opposite of Lauel, but she still respected Lauel. She could clearly feel the existence of the current Empire thanks to Lauel. </p><p>“……”</p><p>Lauel was a clever person. He immediately grasped the meaning and consideration contained in Basara’s words. A life of oppression and using others for the development of the Empire and Grid. Was it necessary to do this in the future? </p><p>He thought about it while watching the faces of the people who filled the banquet hall. After a while, Lauel emptied his glass several more times and said, “That’s right. I would like to go on a vacation.” </p><p>Grid and the Empire had become even stronger. From the time when Grid’s hell expedition, which felt a bit unreasonable, was successfully completed, it became okay to add modifiers such as ‘immortal’ and ‘eternal.’ No matter how many years passed, Grid’s feats wouldn’t be undermined. He would be remembered and praised forever unless the world was destroyed. </p><p>In other words, there was only one thing that the Overgeared Guild should be careful about in the future. It was to prevent the world from being destroyed. </p><p>‘Rebecca.’ </p><p>Lauel responded with a toast to the smiling Basara and raised his head. </p><p>The soaring ceiling—he thought of the sky and Asgard that existed beyond it. He remembered the supreme ruler of Asgard who repeatedly destroyed and recreated the world. </p><p>That’s right. Now there was only one thing for the Overgeared Guild to guard against: Asgard. </p><p>“......?” </p><p>Lauel was contemplating it with a serious face when he suddenly listened carefully. It was because an interesting conversation was taking place at the gathering of Overgeared members. </p><p>“Infinite Tower?” </p><p>“It is weak.”</p><p>“Then... Tower Where You Can Be Infinitely Stronger?” </p><p>Tower? Infinitely stronger? </p><p>Lauel had difficulty leaving the distinguished guests sitting next to him so he sent a whisper to Pon. </p><p>-What are you talking about now? </p><p>-Eat Spicy Jokbal has learned a new ultimate skill. He can build a tower that can be climbed endlessly. </p><p>-......? </p><p>He couldn’t easily understand it. In this case, it was best to ask the person involved. Lauel sent a whisper and Eat Spicy Jokbal explained it. </p><p>-That’s right. I can build a tower. It is even in the instance dungeon format. As you know, dungeon building has many limitations because it eats up a large area, but I have overcome those limitations. </p><p>-It is good news. Then what does it mean to be infinitely stronger? </p><p>-Ah... It is a bit annoying, but there is no limit to the number of floors you can climb. As long as you can raid the boss monsters that exist on each floor, you can theoretically climb a tower with thousands or tens of thousands of floors. </p><p>-Do the boss monsters give rewards? </p><p>-Of course. Haven’t all the training dungeons I’ve built so far give fair rewards? It is like that. The only difference is that only the bosses on every 10th floor give ‘rewards that can be taken out.’ The other bosses give ‘buffs that only apply within the tower.’ </p><p>-Buffs... so you can become infinitely stronger? </p><p>-That’s right. </p><p>-What about the penalty for failing to climb it? </p><p>-If you die or leave of your own volition, you won’t be allowed to re-enter for 48 hours. That is all. If you die, you won’t lose experience or items. </p><p>The utilization was endless. The fact that it was an instance dungeon was the biggest advantage. It seemed that even Eat Spicy Jokbal couldn’t properly judge the level of the rewards. Still, there was no penalty, so the fact that rewards would be given was an unconditional benefit. In some cases, it seemed good for the members of the Overgeared Guild, the knights of the Empire, and the soldiers to climb the tower. </p><p>Just in time, Peak Sword’s voice was heard. “Tower That Grows Stronger As One Climbs It. How about this?” </p><p>“Oh... Isn’t that good? It seems to attract the aggro?” </p><p>“Peak Sword, what is it? Why do you like this?” </p><p>‘As expected, an amazing writer.’ </p><p>Lauel was admiring it only for his expression to distort. </p><p>Did he really like this name? Was this really the influence of Grid? Did his standard go down in the aftermath of suffering from Grid’s naming sense? </p><p>Aside from Lauel’s skepticism, Eat Spicy Jokbal and all the Overgeared members responded positively. Lauel quickly grasped the situation. </p><p>-Are you going to allow outsiders to enter the tower? </p><p>-It will probably be amazing to make a lot of money... of course, I was going to get the permission of you and Grid first. If it doesn’t work, then I won’t do it. </p><p>-No. Do as you please. </p><p>Heaven was different from hell. It was a complete group. This meant that if there was a conflict, a large-scale war was inevitable. As they had learned from the Great Human and Demon War, it wasn’t just the Overgeared Guild who should be strong. Such were the current times. </p><p>-However, can I designate the location where the tower will be built? </p><p>-Of course. </p><p>-I’ll let you know when it is decided. </p><p>Lauel paid attention to the concept of the tower. </p><p>A tower that rose endlessly. </p><p>Maybe. Maybe it could make it all the way to Asgard? </p><p>Asgard was naturally a separate dimension from the surface. It would be hard to reach physically. However, he didn’t think it was impossible. Grid had a history of riding a dragon to heaven. </p><p>‘If only I could get advice from an Old Dragon... depending on the location of the tower, wouldn’t it reach Asgard?’ </p><p>Of course, in order to do this, the tower had to be high enough to reach the sky. In other words, someone had to climb the tower. It might be impossible. Usually, towers with this structure also increased the difficulty level indefinitely. Still, it was worth looking forward to. There was nothing to lose by looking forward to it. Additionally, there was an Old Dragon to ask for advice. </p><p>Evil Dragon Bunhelier—they thought he would be the enemy of humanity, but surprisingly, he was the first Old Dragon who stood on the side of humanity. Of course, Bunhelier didn’t care much about humanity. He cooperated with Grid purely for his own sake. </p><p>Still, that was just the trigger. Lately, the feeling had been very different. He even attended Grid’s wedding today as a guest. He was polymorphed into human form and hid his identity, so there was no disturbance, but... from what he noticed, Bunhelier was interacting with the half-draconians. The king of the half-draconians wasn’t happy and trembled with fear. </p><p>‘In any case, it is good.’</p><p>The Overgeared Guild was blessed. The talented people who gathered around Grid were as great as each other and they hit a jackpot once in a while. Thanks to this, he would be busy again for a while... </p><p>Lauel smiled as he raised the black dragon, making Basara nervous. </p><p>***</p><p>Night—it didn’t impress Marie Rose at all. The concept of time was useless for her, who lived forever. In the first place, she spent most of her time in a coffin. She didn’t distinguish between day and night and was never conscious of it. </p><p>However, it was different today. She felt it the moment she felt Grid’s touch during the daytime wedding. She was going to have a hard time tonight. She knew she would experience all types of things that she had never experienced before at once and would face a tremendous change. </p><p>Tension, anticipation, and fear—emotions that she never imagined before came faintly to her. All of them were emotions that disturbed an Absolute’s clarity quotient. </p><p>Thanks to this, Marie Rose realized how great the man in front of her was. A being who fought to protect his precious things—he must’ve always suffered from these emotions. She thought there must’ve been so many moments when he wanted to run away. </p><p>But now he reached this point. Starting as a weak human being to eventually trying to dominate her... </p><p>Marie Rose stood with her back to the fireworks exploding in the sky and slowly took off her clothes. Areas that no one dared to invade before were laid bare in front of Grid’s eyes. </p><p>“I’m afraid I might be different.” </p><p>Marie Rose didn’t know anyone else. She thought she might be different from others. She was worried. She was afraid she would be different from others and earn Grid’s disgust. </p><p>Grid stared at her in a trance and slowly opened his mouth, “You are different.” </p><p>“……”</p><p>Marie Rose’s expression didn’t change, but inwardly, she was agitated.</p><p>Grid smiled as he counted her dark eyelashes that were trembling very faintly. “It is a beauty I’ve never seen before.” </p><p>The most beautiful woman in the world—Marie Rose’s naked body, which shimmered transparently in the moonlight... the following was omitted. </p><p>Grid’s resolve was shaken. It was his resolve not to sleep with anyone until his ‘vital energy’ gathered. </p><p>‘But I have to endure it no matter what.’ <nfe4f6> Sᴇaʀch* Thᴇ Nʘvᴇl(F)ire.nᴇt website on Gøøglᴇ to access chapters of nøvels early and in the highest quality.</nfe4f6></p><p>Grid shook his head to come to his senses and recalled the events of the day. He recalled the reaction of Marie Rose, who was embarrassed by his touch. He believed in his dexterity, which could work even on an Absolute.</p><p>He would satisfy her without doing it... </p><p>He made up his mind and focused on the situation. He used his fingers and started serving Marie Rose. </p><p>“Ahh...” Marie Rose was captivated by a sensation she never felt before and embraced Grid. </p><p>The snowy white skin exuded heat. It seemed to melt in the aftermath of touching Grid’s heated skin. </p><p>Grid was uneasy. He thought Marie Rose would melt away like this. </p><p>He didn’t want to miss it. </p><p>He gripped her soft skin strongly, leaving red marks. He put his arms between her armpits and strongly restrained her. They were entangled like snakes. </p><p>“...This isn’t enough.” </p><p>He felt dizzy. He wanted to pour everything into it regardless of his vital energy. The more he satisfied Marie Rose, the more Grid was bewitched. Then he came to his senses. </p><p>Marie Rose was sitting on his stomach. </p><p>Suddenly? </p><p>The senses of an Absolute couldn’t read the situation. Grid came to his senses thanks to his great confusion and looked at Marie Rose’s omitted. </p><p>‘I have to endure it. Endure it.’ </p><p>Thus— </p><p>Skipping through the following process, Grid’s efforts continued throughout the night. It felt like he was fighting multiple Baals. His physical strength and mental strength were exhausted tremendously. He felt like giving up several times. Finally, when he pressed his sweat-drenched body against Marie Rose’s back— </p><p>[The ‘Core That Has Existed Since the Beginning of Time’ senses your strong desire.] </p><p>[Do you want your wish to be fulfilled?]</p><p>The item he got in exchange for saving the world reacted.</p><p class="box-notification fs-17">Sᴇarch the <b>N0ᴠᴇFɪre.nᴇt</b> website on Gøøglᴇ to access chapters of nøvels early and in the highest quality.</p></div><h2>Chapter 1865</h2><div><p>Chapter 1864</p><p>[Why did the S.A Group dream of a bad ending?] </p><p>[Chairman Lim Cheolho’s keynote that he wants Satisfy to be a hope for everyone was just a pretense.] </p><p>[Without Grid, all the people comforted by Satisfy would’ve tasted frustration instead of hope.] </p><p>[Does Chairman Lim Cheolho have an antisocial personality disorder?] </p><p>Third-rate media outlets that appealed to sensationalism in order to attract public opinion originally couldn’t easily touch the S.A Group. This was partly due to the enormous power of the S.A Group’s legal team, but more precisely, there were many targets to aim for even if they didn’t touch the S.A Group. </p><p>Right now, these media wanted to dig into Grid and the Overgeared Group. </p><p>Earth and Satisfy—literally, the world’s attention was focused on the performance of Grid and the Overgeared Guild, and there was no target more delicious than them. However, the media didn’t dare to touch them. So instead of the pheasants, they targeted the S.A Group who were chickens. </p><p>“I never thought the day would come when our group would act as breakwater.” <nff6f0> Sᴇaʀᴄh thᴇ NʘvᴇlFɪre.ɴet website on Gøøglᴇ to access chapters of nøvels early and in the highest quality.</nff6f0></p><p>Ever since Satisfy launched its service, the influence of the S.A Group had been comparable to that of the United States and China. It wasn’t uncommon for another individual or group to act as a breakwater for the S.A Group, but this was the first time when the opposite was the case. </p><p>“Nothing lasts forever. However, it is quite a shock to have this experience due to an individual influence.” </p><p>Grid—additionally, the Empire and Overgeared Guild led by Grid. The hero born from Satisfy had become a strong competitor to the S.A Group. </p><p>“...Great.” </p><p>“It is because Grid is really great. Huhu.” </p><p>“I didn’t expect him to kill Baal and get rid of him. One big nuisance is gone, so it feels like a tooth has been knocked out.” </p><p>“Well, if it helps Grid, then it is a breakwater.”</p><p>This wasn’t a board of directors who could be swayed by the press. In the first place, the media is like a reed in front of the wind. It wasn’t worth responding to them one by one. Despite the provocations of the third-rate press, the atmosphere within the group was actually very good. </p><p>It wasn’t an exaggeration to say that the S.A Group was also enjoying the festive atmosphere. In fact, some executives and employees had visited Reinhardt in person and enjoyed the festival. </p><p>Baal—the irregular who turned Satisfy’s worldview into a dystopia. The S.A Group hated him the most in the world. The company was caught up in the rules of not intervening in Satisfy and stood on the sidelines. </p><p>“There is nothing we can do but cheer for them in the future.” </p><p>Rebecca, the Goddess of Light, had the greatest authority within Satisfy. She had such a powerful artificial intelligence that she evolved independently of the group’s will. Depending on what she thought and the choices she made, an irregular like Baal would be born and it was impossible for the group to cope with. It was similar to the feeling of the universe or a transcendent being like a god creating humans and then only being able to watch them. </p><p>Therefore, they relied on players like Grid and supported them for many years. </p><p>Rebecca and other Absolutes joined hands one after another, leading Satisfy to ruin. This was the worst development for the S.A Group. If Grid had failed in this expedition, the S.A Group’s stock price would’ve plummeted right now. They would’ve seriously discussed the introduction of a seasonal system. </p><p>“……”</p><p>The executives smiled happily as they once again checked the soaring stock price. Among them, only Director Yoon Sangmin’s expression was particularly dark. </p><p>The Core That Has Existed Since the Beginning of Time—it could make any wish come true so it was a stone that stimulated the target’s desire. There was already a history of it creating a monster called Baal once. However, it fell into the hands of a player. </p><p>Of course, Director Yoon Sangmin had been watching Grid for a long time and knew him well. He thought the chances of Grid using the core of the beginning to harm Satisfy was close to zero. Even so, there was harm that was done without any malice. Grid had no intention of doing so, but any choice he made could have serious side effects. </p><p>‘I hope he thinks about it...’ </p><p>Director Yoon Sangmin was biting his nails in anxiety, only to soon smile bitterly. He always felt grateful to Grid, but he felt it was a pity that he couldn’t help being suspicious and vigilant every time. </p><p>Well, what could he do? This was the relationship between the operator and the user. </p><p>“By the way...” Director Yoon Sangmin cocked his head. </p><p>Chairman Lim Cheolho, who claimed to be God Grid’s number one fan—he should’ve blessed Grid’s wedding alongside the other executives, but he never showed up at the scene. </p><p>“Is the chairman heartbroken?” Director Yoon Sangmin carefully asked the chief of staff. It was a situation where the third-rate media criticized him as a hypocritical person. It was a sad moment for Chairman Lim Cheolho, who cherished and loved Satisfy more than anyone else. Director Yoon Sangmin felt heavy as he recalled the lonely appearance of the chairman sitting alone in the office and drinking a glass of soju. </p><p>“No,” the chief of staff replied firmly. </p><p>“I’m glad to hear that... then where is he?” </p><p>“He went out. Considering that he gave orders to draw up a list of gifts preferred by men in their 30s, I guess he went to see Grid.” </p><p>Director Yoon Sangmin was the chairman’s closest confidant. </p><p>Yoon Sangmin was relieved thanks to the chief of staff, who spoke frankly. </p><p>‘The chairman is the most excited one.’ </p><p>Indeed, he couldn’t be swayed by the media. </p><p>“......?!” </p><p>Director Yoon Sangmin was smiling happily only to abruptly jump out of his seat. The other executives were also disturbed. </p><p>It was after Grid’s wedding. It was due to the system message that popped up on the screen that was illuminating the night view of Reinhardt and the Tomb of the Gods. </p><p>[Player ‘Grid’ has used REX-001001.] </p><p>REX-001001—as the operations director, Yoon Sangmin knew what this code name meant: The Core That Has Existed Since the Beginning of Time. </p><p>“Did Grid use the wish stone?” </p><p>The other executives noticed the situation one step late and bombarded Director Yoon Sangmin with questions. It was a big reaction. None of the people gathered here had expected that Grid would use the Core That Has Existed Since the Beginning of Time, the ‘wish stone,’ so quickly.</p><p>Director Yoon Sangmin muttered, “He is short-sighted... will there be a situation where the dead are resurrected as Morpheus feared...?” </p><p>It had a relatively high probability of 23.9%. Morpheus had predicted the possibility that Grid would ‘resurrect the dead’ using the wish stone. Khan and the former Red Knights were cited as examples. </p><p>Khan, who lost his young son early on. </p><p>The former Red Knights who were falsely accused and lost their comrades and family members. </p><p>It warned that if Grid immediately resurrected the dead to heal their wounds, all types of chaos would appear in the world. </p><p>‘It is harm without malice.’ </p><p>Director Yoon Sangmin felt the need to quickly assess the situation. He moved immediately to the operations team. This was when the system message took over. </p><p>[Player Grid’s wish has no effect on Satisfy.] </p><p>“......??” </p><p>“......???” </p><p>The wish of a person like Grid had no effect on the world? It was hard to believe. </p><p>“What is the content of his wish?” </p><p>The system replied to Director Yoon Sangmin and the executives, who looked somewhat confused. </p><p>[I can’t tell you in accordance with Article 3, Paragraph 9 of the Terms and Conditions.] </p><p>“……”</p><p>Article 3, Paragraph 9 of the Terms and Conditions—the company respected the privacy of the players. The privacy here meant ‘something that can’t be monitored even with the authority of the operations team.’ In other words, it was a very intimate part of human dignity. </p><p>At this point, Director Yoon Sangmin and the executives all noticed it. It was easier to guess because Grid had just married Marie Rose. </p><p>“I acknowledge this...” someone muttered. </p><p>***</p><p>Really. Grid didn’t come out of the bedroom until the sun rose to the middle of the sky. </p><p>Lauel had served Grid for a long time, but this was the first time he had seen it. In the past, rain or shine, Grid used to get up before anyone else and leave for the smithy or hunting grounds.</p><p>“What...?” Lauel cocked his head. For the first time in a long time, no, for the first time, Grid rested soundly without any worries. </p><p>It was Lauel who had been waiting for Grid, who didn’t come out of the bedroom until late. He had been expecting a refreshed look from Grid. Yet ironically, Grid was even more exhausted than usual. Was he tormented by Marie Rose all night? </p><p>It was impossible. Grid— </p><p>No, every player was sexually constrained in Satisfy. It was natural. Players were only allowed to do it once a month. It was a huge restriction. This was even if they were spending their first night with the person they loved most in the world. It was physically impossible for a player to make love all night. If the timing was wrong, there were many cases where they couldn’t make love even once. </p><p>Of course, Lauel was a bachelor, so he only knew this theoretically, but... </p><p>In any case, there was no problem with his theory based on knowledge and information. </p><p>“Don’t tell me... was your blood sucked all night?” </p><p>“It is similar...?” </p><p>“Marie Rose is a vampire, so she is different from humans. Don’t be too considerate just because you are newly married. You should stay away from her at night.” </p><p>“...In any case, she left.” </p><p>Just a little while ago, right before Grid left through the bedroom door, Marie Rose left the castle through the window. It was as if running away. </p><p>“It is harsher than I was prepared for...” She left with such words. </p><p>Grid reflected on it. From last night to noon today, Marie Rose had passed out 27 times. </p><p>‘I was too excited.’ </p><p>He was fascinated by Marie Rose’s beauty and his eyes went dark when the limit was lifted... Yesterday, he was just a beast... </p><p>Grid sighed while reflecting on himself again. Then he strongly made up his mind. </p><p>‘From now on, let’s manage myself well.’ </p><p>It was a situation where the system couldn’t impose restrictions due to the influence of the Core That Has Existed Since the Beginning of Time. Grid himself had to be careful. He really had to keep his mind tense. </p><p>“By the way, I heard there is a tower?” </p><p>“Yes, I presume it is a tower that can reach the sky. As you know, among the dungeons created by Eat Spicy Jokbal, haven’t the dungeons rated unique or higher naturally expanded in size according to the exploration rate?” </p><p>“So the more you climb the tower, the higher it will go? Maybe it is enough to reach Asgard?” </p><p>“That’s right. Of course, to do that, we need someone who can climb the tower.” </p><p>Grid nodded. </p><p>“Let’s go.” </p><p>After a while— </p><p>“This XX.” </p><p>Grid’s swear words rang out through the tower.</p><p class="box-notification fs-17">Sᴇarch the <b>ɴovᴇlꜰirᴇ.nᴇt</b> website on Gøøglᴇ to access chapters of nøvels early and in the highest quality.</p></div><h2>Chapter 1866</h2><div><p>Chapter 1865</p><p>Dungeon Master Eat Spicy Jokbal—his first work that ventured into the new realm of the tower was very small and shabby. It was only two floors high and it was embarrassing to call it a tower. From the circumference, it was estimated that the floor space was less than 10 pyeong. But no one paid any attention to this. </p><p>A tower that grew stronger as they climbed it—there was such a provocative sign. </p><p>Even Grid was caught by it. </p><p>“Tower That Grows Stronger As One Climbs It... I wonder if we’re giving too grand a name for a tower that hasn’t been finished yet...” </p><p>“It is finished. The number of floors in the tower will naturally be added as users climb to the higher floors, and the interior area is quite reasonable, unlike what it seems.” </p><p>“Ke ong is going to cry.” </p><p>“No, he came to me a while ago and cursed me for profiting for free. The facilities I make are purely ‘dungeons,’ so there is no need for Ke ong to be jealous.” </p><p>Eat Spicy Jokbal was one of the precious treasures of the Empire. Numerous soldiers and knights grew by exploring the dungeons he created. The Overgeared members' growth value exceeded the allowance of the dungeons, but they often stopped by the dungeons to increase their skill experience. </p><p>Now they had to build a tower. It was said that there was no limit to the number of floors. It was theoretically possible to expand indefinitely because another floor opened up every time a user overcame the ordeal of the current topmost floor. </p><p>It was truly a legendary building. No, there was a possibility that it would be worshiped as a myth if Grid utilized it. </p><p>Grid was also the leader of the Overgeared Guild. He had the right and qualification to be the first to set foot in such a monumental facility. </p><p>“Okay. I’ll go up to the 100th floor today.” </p><p>Grid was more motivated than Lauel hoped for and attempted to climb it. </p><p>“This XX.” </p><p>The result was this—he lost motivation. There was no problem from the 1st floor to the 9th floor. Thanks to Demon Sword Remnants, Grid overcame the ordeals without even lifting a finger. It took less than five minutes to reach the 10th floor. </p><p>However, he immediately lost motivation on the 10th floor. </p><p>The boss monster who appeared on the 10th floor—it was none other than Baal. </p><p>That’s right—the boss monster that lurked in the tower on the 10th floor used the ‘highest level opponent among the boss monsters raided by the challenger’ as the basic framework. Here, it became stronger and stronger every time the number of floors increased. Depending on the challenger’s position, it could boast a tremendous level of difficulty. </p><p>“The 10th floor is bullshit...”</p><p>Aren’t I the only one at a disadvantage...? </p><p>Why do you always do this to me...? </p><p>Vantner offered comfort to the lamenting Grid, “Instead, Grid, your wives keep getting stronger. Don’t be too heartbroken and think positively.” </p><p>“......”</p><p>...Wasn’t he hit by this comfort instead? </p><p>It wasn’t very comforting, but Grid couldn’t refute the facts. Instead, Eat Spicy Jokbal asked him, “Why did you come back without fighting Baal?”</p><p>Going up from the 1st floor to the 9th floor, Grid acquired various buffs that were only applied inside the tower. Grid in the tower was stronger than Grid in reality. Even if the level of Baal on the 10th floor was exactly the same as the Baal that Grid had fought a while ago, the current Grid would be able to aim for victory relatively easily. </p><p>However, he retreated without even fighting. It was hard to understand from Eat Spicy Jokbal’s perspective. </p><p>“Isn’t it better that Baal came out? The higher the level of the boss, the greater the rewards.” </p><p>“Do you avoid poop because you are afraid of it? You avoid it because it is dirty.” Peak Sword replied on behalf of Grid. “Have you forgotten how persistent Baal was? From Grid’s perspective, it would be tiresome to fight with him again.” </p><p>It was correct. Just a few days ago, Grid struggled with Baal for more than half a day. Even if he was killed, he resurrected and evolved. It was a fight to the extent that he didn’t want to replay it. </p><p>Then fighting him again right away? He didn’t feel like it even if he was given millions. It wasn’t a situation where he had to fight to protect someone. </p><p>It felt crazy to fight Baal against just to get some small rewards. </p><p>“It is time to take a break,” Peak Sword said while patting Grid’s shoulder. </p><p>A break—it was a word that penetrated Grid’s weary heart. Yes, he wanted to rest... </p><p>Grid realized something and shuddered. He recalled the fact that there were few days he rested properly ever since he became Pagma's Successor. Was this something that people could handle? He couldn’t believe how he had been running non-stop. </p><p>“I’ll leave climbing the tower to you.” </p><p>Now that they had purified hell and brought peace to humanity—if it wasn’t this time, then when else could he rest freely? Right now, Faker and the Overgeared Shadows were in the midst of a quest to find the daoist immortal, Bentao. It was to get help to search for the achievements of the Seven Good People that the gods couldn’t erase. The moment Faker gained something, Asgard wouldn’t be able to sit still. </p><p>Grid had to prepare for another fierce battle from then on. Now was the only time. It was time to get enough rest... </p><p>Grid felt it instinctively and left the scene without regrets. He thought of things to do during his break. The first thing was to find Pagma’s soul. According to Kraugel’s testimony, as Pagma’s soul was possessing him, it encountered Braham and immediately erased his traces. </p><p>Grid hadn’t taken it seriously. It was something he heard while preparing for the wedding, so it went in one ear and out the other. But now that he thought about it, he was worried about Braham’s reaction. </p><p>Pagma just left and Braham was calm? It was impossible. </p><p>‘Maybe Pagma’s soul is...’</p><p>Maybe he wasn’t reincarnated, but was captured by Braham? In the first place, it was a pity that the conversation with Pagma was too short. It was necessary to check it. </p><p>“He is going to rest, right?” </p><p>Peak Sword and his colleagues looked on anxiously as Grid increased his pace. </p><p>***</p><p>Until recently, there were no mountains around Reinhardt. Braham smashed everything. Naturally, there was no malice. It was an inevitable phenomenon in the process of magically tempering Grid’s Greed. But recently, a high mountain stood tall to the west of Reinhardt. It was an artificial mountain made by Braham’s petrification magic. </p><p>Overlooking Reinhardt was Braham’s workshop. <nfa61d> Sᴇaʀᴄh thᴇ N0vᴇlFire(.)nᴇt website on Gøøglᴇ to access chapters of nøvels early and in the highest quality.</nfa61d></p><p>“Braham, you...” </p><p>Grid came to visit Braham’s workshop, only to stiffen like a stone statue. </p><p>Pagma’s soul—he really was trapped in Braham’s workshop. The various tools scattered in all directions conjured up terrible imaginations. </p><p>“Did you torture his soul?” </p><p>It didn’t matter how deep the grudge was. Hadn’t he at least tried to understand Pagma? Now he stopped the reincarnation of the soul and tortured him... </p><p>Grid hadn’t expected Braham’s personality to be this terrible and was in great shock. </p><p>“Don’t be fooled.” Braham clicked his tongue as he grasped a saw and aimed it at Pagma’s soul. </p><p>“Braham...!” </p><p>Was he going to brutally saw at Pagma’s soul? Grid was about to stop it, only to pause. The saw seemed to be imbued with some type of magical effect and started to slice through Pagma’s soul, but it didn’t cause any direct harm to the soul.</p><p>Pagma’s soul was intact. There was only the sound of something invisible being scratched and shaken repeatedly. </p><p>“That guy, Baal, was full of malice to the end.” </p><p>It was a few days ago—Braham faced the soul of Pagma possessing Kraugel and was horrified. It was because Pagma’s soul was secretly bound to Kraugel’s soul. </p><p>At first, he naturally thought it was Pagma’s doing. He thought this damn guy who enjoyed backstabbing others was playing tricks to take away Kraugel’s body. Then he soon calmed down. Pagma wasn’t a great magician like him. It was impossible for a mere blacksmith to cast such a spell in his soul state... </p><p>“Perhaps Baal thought you would take away the power contained in Pagma’s soul.” </p><p>It was a curse carved into Pagma’s soul. What Baal left behind was a structure that made Pagma’s soul the subject when combined with an object. To put it simply, it was designed to ‘take away the body of the one possessed by Pagma’s soul.’ </p><p>If such a situation had happened— </p><p>It wasn’t only the victim whose body was taken away. Even Pagma, who took over the body, must’ve been in great shock. </p><p>‘He would’ve been in deep despair.’ </p><p>Pagma’s specialty might be to use and betray others, but there was always a good reason for it. He had never betrayed others for his own sake. However, who would’ve trusted Pagma if the situation had gone as Baal intended? Naturally, Pagma would’ve been blamed for the incident. Additionally, the one cutting off Pagma’s head and killing him would've been none other than Braham himself. </p><p>“Baal...” Grid learned the inside story and gritted his teeth. He was already in a sensitive state because he just met Baal at the tower. Therefore, he even wanted to swear. </p><p>Braham smirked as he felt Pagma’s bewildered soul. “This guy is the greatest hero in history, but he doesn’t know how to pretend. He is honest in most situations.” </p><p>It is different from you... </p><p>-......</p><p>Pagma’s soul fell silent at the words that sounded like accusations toward him. Pagma’s feelings were also conveyed to Braham through the magic saw that was splitting apart the curse on his soul. </p><p>Regret. </p><p>The hero of the previous era who fought alone because he couldn’t trust anyone—in the name of his cause, he undermined the dignity of others. He committed countless vicious acts in order to confront the demons he couldn’t handle alone, such as damaging other heroes, digging up graves, and binding souls. </p><p>The result was this. He finally made a pact with the ruler of demons. Even now, hundreds of years later, he was still cursed. He almost harmed the heroes of the present age. </p><p>-I... if I had trusted and relied on you... </p><p>Pagma’s trembling voice echoed hollowly in the room. The sadness in his eyes as he looked at Braham grew uncontrollably. </p><p>“......”</p><p>Braham didn’t reply. He silently concentrated on sawing. </p><p>It happened as an awkward silence filled the space... </p><p>The curse that had been dwelling in Pagma’s soul was finally completely destroyed.</p><p>Braham put down the saw and opened his mouth, “What is the point of regret?” </p><p>-......</p><p>Pagma’s eyes met Braham’s and he realized it for the first time—Braham’s red, transparent eyes were looking at the present, not the past. He was dismissing the past as something trivial. </p><p>“Putting aside my feelings, you did your best in the past. As a result, Grid of the present day saved the world. Isn’t that enough? Don’t tie yourself to meaningless regret and go away.” </p><p>They were harsh words. It was close to condemnation. However, Grid knew Braham’s personality well. He was able to interpret the sincerity of the words. </p><p>So he selflessly conveyed it, “I can’t say that the choices you made in the past are right. However, it is obvious that Braham and I exist today because of the past you. I don’t dare to judge if you did well or not. Still, I respect and admire your life. Thank you for your hard work. Now rest in peace.” </p><p>Even when they met earlier, Grid had fully conveyed his feelings to Pagma. Still, it didn’t matter if he repeated it a few times. Rather, he felt it was lacking. </p><p>-......</p><p>This was enough comfort for Pagma. There was a faint smile on his face as his soul lost its form and scattered. </p><p>[The Legendary Blacksmith, ‘Pagma,’ has ascended.] </p><p>[Will you bless him so he is given a new life and is reborn somewhere else in the world?]</p><p>Probably—it was likely a hidden effect created by the combination of his status as a god of the surface and his past status as Pagma's Successor. </p><p>Grid nodded without hesitation. “Of course, I bless him.” </p><p>I’m sorry, and thank you... </p><p>The last words from Pagma’s soul soothed even the resentment that had been stagnating deep in Braham’s heart. One silver lining was that it had finally come to a complete end. </p><p>Braham spoke as Grid’s heart was feeling warm. “No matter whether it is a daughter or a son.” </p><p>“......?” </p><p>“My nephew or niece will be raised by my hands. I can’t leave child raising to Marie Rose, who only knows herself.” </p><p>“No, what...?” </p><p>Grid was about to ask what nonsense Braham was saying when he suddenly shut up. He thought that Braham’s senses must’ve grasped in detail what happened in his bedroom last night. </p><p>“Please respect my privacy...”</p><p class="box-notification fs-17">Sᴇarch the <b>NøᴠᴇlFire.nᴇt</b> website on Gøøglᴇ to access chapters of nøvels early and in the highest quality.</p></div><h2>Chapter 1867</h2><div><p>Chapter 1866</p><p>In short, it was amazing. The tower built by Eat Spicy Jokbal became a new landmark of Reinhardt. </p><p>Peak Sword clicked his tongue when he witnessed the endless procession of people. “They seem to be coming from all over the continent. It is a reaction beyond imagination. If outsiders want to use the tower, then don’t they have to sign a one-sided contract with Eat Spicy Jokbal?” <nfdb5b> Sᴇaʀᴄh the N0vᴇlFirᴇ.ɴet website on Gøøglᴇ to access chapters of nøvels early and in the highest quality.</nfdb5b></p><p>“It is similar to any other dungeon. Some of the experience and rewards obtained from entering the tower will be handed over to Eat Spicy Jokbal.” </p><p>“Are there still people?” </p><p>“Of course.” </p><p>The tower got stronger as a person went up, so the biggest strength was that it was good to use when stuck. If they leveled up, then the experience obtained from existing hunting grounds would decrease significantly. If they didn’t have enough specs to use the higher hunting grounds, then they could visit the tower and significantly speed up their growth rate. It wasn’t a loss even if they had to give a few percent as compensation to Eat Spicy Jokbal. Additionally, the proportion of compensation transferred by individuals decreased significantly as the number of users of the tower increased. </p><p>“I think I should live life like Jokbal.” </p><p>If he built a few dungeons, he could put his hands behind his back and experience and money would roll in on their own... </p><p>It was truly the dignity of a building owner. </p><p>It happened as Peak Sword felt his stomach cramp with envy and frowned... </p><p>“It isn’t that much. If I was making such a huge profit as you think, would I be living like this?” Eat Spicy Jokbal approached and explained. “Most of the money I earn goes to maintaining and repairing dungeons.” </p><p>Of course, every act of working in the dungeon was a valuable experience for Eat Spicy Jokbal. Thanks to this, Eat Spicy Jokbal always maintained the top ranking even if he didn’t participate in raids or hunting. </p><p>“If I want to make money properly, I have to run a dungeon as a trap... You know, I’ve quit doing such things since I joined the Overgeared Guild.” </p><p>“Didn’t you not do that in the first place?” </p><p>“You are mistaken. I didn’t do it at all.” </p><p>There was a time when Eat Spicy Jokbal shoveled directly. He could make dungeons and towers on a whim now that he was a legend, but in the past, Eat Spicy Jokbal used to dig at the ground by hand and build dungeons one by one using tools. He might’ve been the head of the notorious dark gamer group called Blood Carnival, but he didn’t have time to commit evil acts. </p><p>Of course, this didn’t mean Eat Spicy Jokbal’s past should be glorified. Eat Spicy Jokbal was reflecting on himself, which was why he gave people dungeons and towers. Of course, he was paid for the use... </p><p>In any case, there were many players who could breathe thanks to Eat Spicy Jokbal. One of the figures who greatly contributed to the image of the Overgeared Guild was Eat Spicy Jokbal. </p><p>“By the way, the guild members are having a surprisingly hard time.” </p><p>He remembered the days when he was active under the cool stage name of Dark. Eat Spicy Jokbal remembered being beaten to death by Grid, who suddenly broke into the dungeon, and changed the topic. </p><p>He opened the ranking list. There were very few Overgeared members on the list of people who had climbed up high. </p><p>Lauel shook his head. “I’m afraid it can’t be helped. They are in a much more disadvantageous position compared to ordinary players.” </p><p>The Overgeared Guild had fought against strong enemies. The level of the boss monster they raided recently was at least a high ranking great demon, so they had a hard time breaking through the upper floors of the tower. In particular, the members who participated in the hell expedition recently were struggling. </p><p>They all failed to break through the 10th floor. The enemy they faced when they got to the 10th floor was the red lump of flesh, Asura, or King Daebyeol. </p><p>“Use vulgar words to say we are screwed. I’m not God Grid. How can I defeat King Daebyeol alone...?” </p><p>Of course, the tower gave all types of buffs. It was from ordinary buffs that increased their stats to buffs that increased their ‘status’ or suspended death. Together, they had a very powerful effect. </p><p>Right away, Peak Sword was much stronger inside the tower than he was outside. He was even lucky to gain several of the best buffs while climbing from the 1st to the 9th floor. Putting it together, it was enough to treat himself as a high-ranking transcendent. </p><p>However, the enemy was an Absolute God. He might’ve been reduced to a ‘soul body’ and was far short of his prime, but he wasn’t someone Peak Sword could face alone. </p><p>“This is completely wrong. We are all doomed unless you improve the system in a way that allows you to set the boss we encounter on the 10th floor.” </p><p>It was obviously good for the players to grow, but the Overgeared Guild couldn’t be left behind. Peak Sword expressed concern, but Eat Spicy Jokbal responded with disapproval. </p><p>“I don’t have the authority to change the system... How can I intervene in the set system when it is even impossible for Grid? For example, even Grid will only end up with a wooden sword if he uses wood as a material for a sword...” </p><p>Eat Spicy Jokbal was using Grid as an example to make it easier for Peak Sword to understand, only to suddenly shut his mouth. It was because the wooden sword made by Grid seemed to be able to cut through even a small iron sword. </p><p>“Um... There might be room for intervention as the tower’s level increases...” </p><p>Eat Spicy Jokbal was changing his words only to close his mouth again. It was due to the notification window that just appeared. </p><p>[Player ‘Kraugel’ has broken through the 10th floor of the tower.] </p><p>“Wow, how did he do it?” </p><p>All the Overgeared members who participated in the hell expedition were stuck at the 10th floor. Kraugel’s situation was the same. He would’ve also met King Daebyeol as the boss for the 10th floor. Did he break through? </p><p>“15 hours...? Did he take advantage of the inability to recover debuff?” </p><p>Eat Spicy Jokbal noticed something after checking Kraugel’s clearance time. In the list of buffs that could be obtained from the tower, there was a buff that ‘applies an unrecoverable state to the target every time you attack the target.’ It was a buff with an ordinary performance so the selection rate was low compared to other buffs that were so excellent that they didn’t exist in reality. However, under such circumstances, Kraugel used it to successfully climb to the 11th floor. </p><p>“What?” </p><p>Peak Sword learned the inside story after hearing Eat Spicy Jokbal’s explanation and admired it in many ways. It was hard to believe he succeeded in the raid by only hitting the target for 15 hours... In order for that to be possible, there was the prerequisite that combat sustainability had to be preserved for 15 hours. In other words, Kraugel couldn’t allow many hits from King Daebyeol. He also had to use the smallest movements possible to preserve his stamina. </p><p>“It is all in the realm of control so it isn’t a big surprise. They will have to retry several times to succeed, but there are many people in the Overgeared Guild who can do it as well as Kraugel.’ </p><p>The part where Peak Sword greatly admired Kraugel was his mind, not his physical ability. Perhaps Kraugel paid attention to the fact that the tower’s buff boasted an absolute effect. </p><p>A debuff that applied an unrecoverable state to the attacked target. It was a debuff that most monsters in reality were resistant to. Very few tower climbers would’ve chosen it as a reward. </p><p>However, Kraugel chose it. He predicted from the start that the boss of the tower wouldn’t be able to resist the concept of absolute effect within the tower. </p><p>“That guy is amazing... He deserves to be called the next God Grid.” </p><p>Peak Sword’s motivation was aroused. “I should also start over.” </p><p>It was like he hadn’t even climbed to the 9th floor. The determined Peak Sword reset the status of the challenge. Then he started climbing the tower again from the 1st floor. He was going to repeatedly play it until the unrecoverable debuff popped up on the rewards list. </p><p>On the other hand—</p><p>“I was lucky.” </p><p>Inside the tower, Kraugel was taking a breather. The low-level reward that he unluckily obtained on the 9th floor—he hadn’t expected that he would succeed in breaking through the 10th floor thanks to this unrecoverable debuff. There was no other way to explain the situation than to say he was lucky... </p><p>“It will be faster from the 20th floor onwards.” </p><p>There were as many as seven rewards obtained from raiding King Daebyeol on the 10th floor and four of them were buffs applied to his current tower run. Thanks to this, his attack power had become many times more powerful. </p><p>King Daebeyol, whom he would meet again on the 20th floor, would be stronger compared to the 10th floor King Daebyeol, but it was unlikely his health and defense would be exponentially multiplied. Therefore, Kraugel judged that it would be possible to defeat him quickly. </p><p>***</p><p>“The cheetah was just laughing...”</p><p>“Yes...” </p><p>In the last week, ordinary players were enjoying the greatest joy ever. </p><p>Tower That Grows Stronger As One Climbs It—Eat Spicy Jokbal’s new game... no, it was because there were very few Overgeared members on the dungeon ranking list. Under the same conditions (?), they weren’t inferior to the Overgeared Guild. Many people mistakenly thought this and felt a great deal of pride. </p><p>Then three days ago. </p><p>Kraugel suddenly rose to the top of the rankings. Then today, the entire ranking list was changed to the Overgeared Guild. In just three days, an extreme change took place. </p><p>People were forced to admit it. The Overgeared Guild were just late starters. </p><p>They watched us from the starting point as if we were cute and then started climbing slowly. </p><p>At this point, they became curious. Grid still wasn’t on the ranking list. He seemed to be neglecting the tower to enjoy his newlywed life, but how fast would he rise to first in the rankings...? </p><p>The media started to speculate about it. The cast of some famous entertainment programs even made a bet during the broadcast. It was a bet about how many days it would take for Grid to take 1st place from the time that he first appeared on the ranking list. </p><p>World star Hallyu idols, Hollywood actors, and so on. It became a hot topic because the list of people involved was so glamorous. </p><p>Grid felt like he was going to die. “Leave me alone...” </p><p>Grid returned after a well-deserved rest where he gave a generous amount of love to Irene, Mercedes, Basara, and Marie Rose. Grid had grasped the trend and had been thinking about slowly climbing the tower, but he quickly lost his motivation. </p><p>Looking at the atmosphere, it felt like he would have to climb the tower without a break as soon as his name appeared in the ranking list. Of course, no one forced Grid to be a ranker, but there was such an atmosphere. It was a matter of pride. </p><p>-Kraugel, isn’t it time for you to go to eat? </p><p>-It is okay. My mother went on a holiday with some of her friends. </p><p>-...She’s made new friends in the United States. It is great. </p><p>The news that a friend’s mother had completely recovered her health and became as normal as everyone else made Grid genuinely happy. It warmed his heart and made him smile. </p><p>But that was that and this was this. </p><p>‘No, please take it easy.’ </p><p>The 227th floor—Grid was frowning as he reconfirmed Kraugel’s unrivaled lead, only to suddenly smile. Old memories came flooding back. How long had it been since he was in the position of challenger? </p><p>“It is Grid.” </p><p>“Wow.” </p><p>“A true cheetah is finally rising...!” </p><p>Tower That Grows Stronger As One Climbs It—the group of people were buzzing after discovering that Grid had arrived there. Due to this, Grid emerged from his reminiscence to realize reality, but he couldn’t frown because he was a god. He tried to keep the smile on his face as he responded to the enthusiastic cheers. </p><p>“I hear that top stars line up for your autographs when you go to the broadcasting stations?” </p><p>“That is a rumor you made.” Grid happened to encounter Peak Sword at the tower and failed to manage his expression. </p><p>Peak Sword laughed. “I was just telling the truth. Oh, my~ I’m tired. I reached 9th in the ranking, so I’ll take a good rest today. Ah, come to think of it, are you parked on the 9th floor, God Grid? The two of us are the ‘same’ number. Haha.” </p><p>“…….”</p><p>“Take your time, take your time. There is nothing special about being a ranker here, so there is no reason to be enthusiastic, right? Didn’t Mir confirm the reincarnation of King Daebyeol? Take it easy when you should be resting. The air below is clear and good, right?” </p><p>Peak Sword and the members of the Overgeared Guild were people who loved games. They liked the game so hard that they tried hard. Thanks to it, they connected with Grid after becoming rankers and had reached this point. Basically, there was a strong sense of competition. </p><p>That’s right. Right now, Peak Sword was sincerely encouraging Grid to rest, but was also keeping him in check. The provocation was a bonus. There was no malice in it. It was just a natural gamer’s disposition. It wasn’t a matter that Grid could simply pass over. </p><p>“Peak Sword, you are the one who needs to get some clear air below and rest. Sooner or later, the 190th floor will be the below area.” </p><p>“Wow.” </p><p>One by one, numerous witnesses started to log out. It was to quickly deliver Grid’s declaration of war to the community. Grid responded to the public’s attention in a different way than intended... </p><p>Peak Sword clenched his hands tightly and his expression stiffened as he belatedly regretted it. “Truly God Grid... You are a true superstar.” </p><p>“......”</p><p>Grid returned from his vacation. He walked into the tower that was very tall, unlike the first day he saw it. </p><p>At the same time, hell... </p><p>“Why aren’t there many visitors...?” </p><p>The 1st ranked Archangel, Raphael, had assumed that the Overgeared members would focus on defeating the remnants of the demons in hell. They planned to snipe at Jishuka in order to recover the power of King Daebyeol and they had already been staying in hell for nearly ten days. </p><p>Everything was quiet. The desired situation never happened. They were already nervous about how long they would have to stay in this filthy and uncivilized place that was unlike Asgard. </p><p>The great demon sisters who were working with Raphael made eye contact and smiled. </p><p>The Black and White sisters—originally, they became great demons to eavesdrop on the 1st Great Demon, Baal, but they missed the opportunity to stand out and wandered for a while. They honestly regretted making such an extreme choice. </p><p>But now it was fun. </p><p>The number one Archangel, Raphael. Compared to the 1st ranked Great Demon, someone worthy of being targeted came rolling in on their own.</p><p class="box-notification fs-17">Sᴇarch the <b>NʘvᴇlFire.nᴇt</b> website on Gøøglᴇ to access chapters of nøvels early and in the highest quality.</p></div><h2>Chapter 1868</h2><div><p>Chapter 1867</p><p>The inside of the Tower That Grows Stronger As One Climbs It was very spacious. It was different from when looking at it from the outside. </p><p>‘Every time I see this, I think it is a good thing that I have Eat Spicy Jokbal.’ </p><p>A player with the ability to create an instance dungeon—Eat Spicy Jokbal was the only one. </p><p>The dungeons he built were always useful. In particular, the tower he made this time was special. In just a few days, the tower had risen to 227 floors. If it continued to rise like this, wouldn’t it really reach Asgard? </p><p>Lauel’s seemingly far-fetched conjecture started to be credible. However, it would probably take at least 1,000 floors to be seen properly. </p><p>‘1,000 floors...’</p><p>It felt so far away, but also surprisingly close. It took Kraugel just a week to reach the 227th floor. Additionally, the pace of his climb increased every day. It was thanks to the rewards obtained every time a new floor was conquered. This meant that the climber’s growth rate might be faster than the speed at which the boss monster that appeared in 10 floor increments became stronger. </p><p>‘Let’s only struggle up to the 50th floor.’ </p><p>Baal—Grid felt hopeless about having to fight that damn cockroach again, but he breathed in deeply and soothed his mind. Then he took a lunch box out of his inventory. It was the lunch box that Irene made when she woke up at dawn. She even baked the bread herself. </p><p>Last night—she hadn’t forgotten Grid’s words that he should finish his rest and resume his activities. </p><p>‘Meat, garlic, meat, meat...’</p><p>Was garlic the only vegetable...? Why? He wasn’t complaining about the side dishes. He was just puzzled. It was very different from the diet organized by Irene, who often tried to feed Lord vegetables at family meals. </p><p>Grid was cocking his head when he found a note from Irene and opened it. </p><p>-You have been amazing every night lately. I prepared a lunch box with the hope that my dear husband will maintain your vitality even when you return from a great cause. Please enjoy it and have strength. </p><p>“......”</p><p>He thought he would have to work hard tonight as well... Grid read Irene’s inner thoughts and was motivated. It had only been a day or two since he became a beast every night. Every time he turned into a beast, he would think, ‘Is this really okay?’ He felt uneasy about it. </p><p>Grid had four people to love. Irene might not know it, but every time she fainted, Grid alternately visited Mercedes, Basara, and Marie Rose. He tried his best with the thought that it wasn’t right to leave his wives alone when he had broken the limit using the wish stone acquired from killing Baal. It was worthwhile, but... </p><p>Grid slowly chewed every piece of meat and garlic carefully packed in the lunch box while glaring at the entrance of the 10th floor, which lurked beyond the 9th floor. It shouldn’t take half a day this time... </p><p>Grid completely changed his mindset and ignited his fighting spirit. </p><p>‘Six hours. Kill him in six hours.’ </p><p>After the success of the hell expedition, Grid had grown exponentially stronger. It wasn’t just because of additional factors such as the stats redistribution, Baal’s power, and Amoract’s power. It was simply because his specs itself had gone up significantly. After surpassing level 1,000, he secured a large number of stat points and even enjoyed the awakening effect. </p><p>On the other hand, Baal would be exactly as Grid remembered. Infinite resurrection was impossible. Baal was no longer an object of fear. Of course, Baal would have a passive ability to overcome death, but there would always be a limit to the number of times. </p><p>“Let’s go.” </p><p>[Thanks to the effect of the ‘Empress’ Lunch Box,’ all stats are increased by 30% for 30 minutes.] </p><p>The food buff effect was also more than expected. As expected, the power of love was a great thing... </p><p>Grid realized it and entered the 10th floor where Baal welcomed him as before. Of course, he didn’t say anything. This was just his appearance. He might look like Baal and use the same abilities, but he couldn’t think. </p><p>[’Demon Sword Remnants’ has reacted.] </p><p>If Grid encountered an enemy, the first one to move was no longer Grid. It was the dark demon sword. The three meter long sword, which subtly emitted a blood red glow from the cracks carved everywhere, reacted and acted before Grid. </p><p>The tower shook in the aftermath of the collision between demon sword and demon sword. It was a shaking that only Grid felt. </p><p>In any case, it was an instance dungeon. Grid moved without hesitation. He didn’t care at all about the tower collapsing and invested all his stats in intelligence to cast magic. He reached Baal one step ahead of the magic bombardment he fired earlier and swung Defying the Natural Order. Naturally, he changed his stats to be invested into strength. </p><p>“”...Kuock...!”” </p><p>Baal couldn’t even utter a proper scream. </p><p>He trembled in pain in the aftermath of being cut by Grid, who had dug into his right side that was defenseless after he blocked the demon sword that suddenly flew in. Then Baal was swept away by the magic bombardment that rained down shortly afterwards. He didn’t even have a chance to fight back. </p><p>“Um...?” </p><p>Stagger. </p><p>Baal started to receive the attack of the God Hands in addition to the demon sword and he resisted with precarious movements. His whole body was covered with wounds, so he had a lot of restrictions in his movements. Grid observed his wounds recovering in real time and questioned it. ‘The ability to recover quickly is the same as the real one, so why is he so weak?’ </p><p>Was it because the boss that appeared every ten floors was weaker than the original? If he knew this would happen, he wouldn’t have run away on the first day and would’ve just beaten Baal up... </p><p>Grid clicked his tongue and twisted his upper body to the side. His eyes were fixed on Baal, who was heading toward him after breaking through the encirclement of the God Hands. Baal’s demon sword passed by the tip of Grid’s nose and the afterglow of Defying the Natural Order shone on it. </p><p>Pagma’s Sword Dance obtained after completing the class quest—one of them, Splendor, was activated. Splendor was the only one of Pagma’s Sword Dance’s that had a different style. It wasn’t a dance move. Instead, magic power was given to the sword and spread a brilliant splendor. In a sacrificial sense, it meant wanting the attention of the gods. In practical terms, it increased the power of the sword. </p><p>It was a buff skill. </p><p>Pagma's Successor—a trash class with poor buff skills. It was designed so that he could only pretend to be a person after he completed the class quest... </p><p>[The weapon’s attack power will increase by three times for 15 seconds. Within the duration of the buff, the power of the first sword dance is increased by 800%, the power of the second sword dance is increased by 1,200%, the power of the third sword dance is increased by 2,000%, and the power of the fourth sword dance is increased by 3,500%.] </p><p>Grid turned back his torso that had been twisted and his sword descended. It was another sword dance that he got after completing the class quest, Chop. It was similar to Pinnacle, but it was different. Pinnacle was a sword dance that was unconditionally a downward swing, while Chop could be used in all types of forms, like a basic hit. It could be used when cutting down, cutting up, or cutting diagonally. </p><p>The attack coefficient was low, but the utility was endless. In most situations, it was good to use it as a leading move of a linked sword dance. </p><p>Baal’s back was cut and his posture broke. Then he was hit by Grid’s six fusion sword dance. </p><p>Fusion. In other words, thanks to becoming one, it fully received the buff effect of Splendor. </p><p>Several notification windows popped up. </p><p>[Baal has overcome death.] </p><p>[Baal has overcome death.] </p><p>[Baal has overcome...] </p><p>……<nf9495> Sᴇaʀᴄh the ɴøvᴇlFɪre.ɴet website on Gøøglᴇ to access chapters of nøvels early and in the highest quality.</nf9495></p><p>…</p><p>‘As expected, he isn’t someone who dies easily.’ </p><p>He noticed from this moment that the super-fast recovery ability was the same as the real thing. The 10th floor Baal might be weaker than the real thing, but he wouldn’t die easily. In the worst case, he might have to fight for half a day... </p><p>Grid frowned and immediately linked a new six fusion sword dance. It was possible thanks to the Chop sword dance. Chop really got rid of the delay caused by the motion right after the fusion sword dance ended. It was an extreme use of the advantages of Chop, which could be activated in most situations. Thanks to this, Baal was unable to resist the six fusion sword dance that was linked without a time difference and allowed it to hit him again. The sword dance also carried the buff effect of Splendor this time. </p><p>Once the third six fusion sword dance was linked in the same way, Baal failed to resist again. As a result, he died. </p><p>“...Huh?” </p><p>He already died? </p><p>‘Even if this is the 10th floor, isn’t it too fragile compared to the real thing?’ </p><p>It hurt so much that he gave up on the first day... Grid was once again filled with regret. Then dozens of cards popped up in front of his eyes. It was all the back of the cards. </p><p>Every 10 floors, he could reveal up to 20 cards. Every time he revealed them, the rewards would appear and he could choose seven of them. The ratings ranged from a minimum of 1 to a maximum of 5. The higher, the better. </p><p>‘Please let it be 5. A tier 5 reward.’ </p><p>Grid prayed and opened a card. </p><p>[Tier 2 Soul Enhancement Stone] </p><p>[You can get 100 stat points when you take it. </p><p>It applies only in the tower.] </p><p>“...Very good.” </p><p>It was positive that it wasn’t tier 1. It meant he wasn’t completely out of luck. As expected, it was thanks to his high luck stat. </p><p>Grid took it positively and opened the remaining 19 cards at once. The result was one tier 4 card and 18 tier 2-3 cards. Furthermore, there were no rewards that could be taken out. They were buff rewards that only applied inside the tower. </p><p>“Don’t go overboard.” </p><p>Grid was able to endure the urge to swear severely. The fact that not a single tier 1 card was displayed meant that the effect of the luck stat was working properly. It was just that his innate bad luck was so strong that a tier 5 card didn’t pop up... </p><p>“...Thinking like this makes me even angrier?” </p><p>If he had gone through this just a few weeks ago, he wouldn’t have calmed down so easily. But the current Grid easily calmed down. Based on the fact that Baal’s level was lower than expected, he decided that it wasn’t a big deal. </p><p>‘After all, I still get rewards every time I climb a floor.’ </p><p>Above all, his soaring anger easily subsided when he thought of the faces of his loved ones. </p><p>‘I need to hurry if I want to go home early.’ </p><p>Grid burned with the desire to be with his beautiful wives. The power of beauty. No, the power of love was such a great thing. Those who hadn’t experienced it wouldn’t know. For example, Vantner had no experience. </p><p>“Is he crazy?” </p><p>Thanks to the rewards from the tower, Vantner had access to higher level hunting grounds. He had been trying to go forward, only for his progress to be blocked again. Therefore, he went back to the tower, only to be shocked. It was due to the status of the rankings. </p><p>Grid, who had just entered the tower this morning, was already ranked 10th. </p><p>“A bug? How did he climb 180 floors in half a day?” </p><p>The level of the boss monster that appeared in the tower was ‘the same as the real thing.’ Additionally, they got stronger as the floors got higher, so they eventually transcended the real thing. Of course, the climber also got stronger due to the steady stream of buffs, but it was barely able to balance out unless the climber was lucky enough to get a tier 5 buff. This meant that the climbing speed didn’t increase significantly. </p><p>Grid’s climbing speed was clearly abnormal. It was all the more so considering that it took him over a day to defeat Baal not long ago. </p><p>Eat Spicy Jokbal explained it to Vantner, who was feeling great confusion. “It seems that he only chose the buffs that only applied in the tower as the reward for each climb.” </p><p>“What? Then isn’t there nothing left?” </p><p>“You know that there has been too much attention on him. It must’ve been an inevitable choice to save face.” </p><p>“Ah, really... Grid has it tough in many ways. No... Isn’t this still too fast...?” </p><p>“...It is because he is ridiculously strong.” </p><p>Eat Spicy Jokbal trembled with fear. Grid’s strength as he killed Baal within 10 minutes every time he encountered Baal every ten floors was beyond common sense. He had become exponentially stronger compared to the time when he went on the hell expedition not long ago. It seemed that the reward for raiding Baal alone was greater than imagined. </p><p>“This damn thing.” </p><p>In the midst of the solemn atmosphere, Peak Sword rushed in. He checked the ranking of Grid, who had been chasing him from the bottom, with a disbelieving face and hurriedly entered the tower. </p><p>‘Of course, I knew he would catch up eventually. But it is ridiculous to catch up in one day. I can’t accept it.’ </p><p>I also have to save some face... </p><p>I’ll also choose buffs that only applied in the tower as the rewards... </p><p>Peak Sword noticed the secret to Grid’s high-speed climb and was prepared, but it was useless. Just because he only wanted buffs didn’t mean he only received buffs. It was only possible with bad luck. </p><p>Grid ended up encountering it thanks to his bad luck. As a result, it could be said that he was lucky. </p><p>His achievement of reaching the top of the list in just one day after he started the climb made people cheer again.</p><p class="box-notification fs-17">Sᴇarch the <b>Nʘvᴇl(F)ire.nᴇt</b> website on Gøøglᴇ to access chapters of nøvels early and in the highest quality.</p></div><h2>Chapter 1869</h2><div><p>Chapter 1868</p><p>“Martial God... it is the Martial God.” </p><p>The Martial God—it had a special meaning in Satisfy. It was a title granted to only one being, so the weight was enormous. However, at this moment... </p><p>The crowd gathered under the tower murmured ‘Martial God.’ </p><p>The first day of the climb—it was while checking the ranking of Grid, who reached the 201st floor in just 15 hours. In the first place, Grid had a history of defeating the Martial God. Who else could they call the Martial God if not Grid? </p><p>“Cool! God Grid!” </p><p>“I’m always cheering for you!” </p><p>There were enthusiastic cheers for Grid as he emerged from the tower. People’s favorability for Grid was at an all-time high. Lately, even the Grid anti-fan cafes had been flooded with posts praising Grid. </p><p>‘That is enough for today.’ </p><p>The Baal he met on the higher floors became stronger. In particular, the unit of his health gauge changed starting from the 100th floor. Unfortunately, he decided that it would be better to stop climbing today. He didn’t want to make Irene wait all night, and he couldn’t raise the ranking further just because he stayed up tonight. </p><p>Grid responded to people with a wave and checked the ranking list. </p><p>‘The level is different from 7th place onward.’ </p><p>Yura, Jishuka, Chris, Katz, Haster, Hurent, and Kraugel—all seven of them had surpassed the 260th floor, and half of them had even surpassed the 300th floor. Their climbing speed was also getting faster every day. Despite how fast Grid’s climbing speed was, it wasn’t enough to catch up to them in just a day or two. </p><p>Of course, Grid thought the Overgeared members outside these seven were great as well. Take Peak Sword as a simple example. If someone asked Grid to raid King Daebyeol with the specs of Peak Sword, he would refpuse no matter what. It might be different if he kept climbing the tower and got enough buffs. </p><p>However, meeting King Daebyeol on the 10th floor, in his almost purely original state, it was difficult to guarantee the odds. Of course, he would succeed in the raid someday if he kept trying, but just imagining it made him sick. Taking 10 to 20 hours to gnaw away at an opponent who was overwhelmingly stronger than him, not allowing their attacks to hit—Grid would want to die. </p><p>In the first place, he didn’t want to do that, so he had been relying on the power of items. </p><p>Grid flew slowly toward the castle where Irene was waiting and his body and mind were infinitely lighter. </p><p>The time to relax—it was the greatest gift Grid had received in return for purifying hell. Until a few days ago, Grid had suffered from great anxiety every day and struggled to become stronger somehow. In fact, he was actually suffering every day. He couldn’t show it in front of others, but he often wondered how he had come to take on such responsibility and felt skeptical. But it was all over now. </p><p>The demons who disguised themselves as humans to deceive people and incite quarrels no longer existed. The king of demons, who reigned as the source of fear while restraining the souls of dead humans, also perished and left only the remnants of the demon sword. </p><p>A near-perfect peace had come. There were variables such as Asgard and the Hwan Kingdom, but he didn’t want to think about that for the time being. </p><p>In the first place, the gods were different from demons. They had too many things to lose to infiltrate the surface disguised as humans or to openly invade. They would lose their prestige and have their status damaged the moment they experienced one failure. They were passive because they knew they eventually wouldn’t be able to exist as gods. </p><p>‘Plus—’ </p><p>The surface was the Overgeared World and the Overgeared World was another divine world. The penalties received by the celestial gods here were staggering. The proof was that neither Zeratul nor Dominion could do anything to Grid when he was much weaker than he was now. It was safe to say that there was little possibility of being invaded by the gods in any form. </p><p>"……!” </p><p>Grid was smiling in appreciation of being able to relax only to stop in the air. Hundreds of God Hands moved in unison. They spread shields over the heads of children rushing after the trail of divinity and led the market vendors to a safe place. It looked like they were preparing for war. </p><p>Thanks to this, the soldiers patrolling the streets immediately noticed the anomaly. They started following the God Hands and enforced the people’s evacuation. </p><p>The sound of horses being ridden was heard everywhere. It was the sound of knights rushing to the scene. </p><p>Despite the death of Baal, the purification of hell, and the return of peace, Reinhardt’s discipline was still as sharp as a blade. The talents that Lauel assigned to the right places responded quickly and organically to the situation. </p><p>“Focus on protecting human life.” </p><p>It happened the moment Grid gave an order to Sariel, who came to his side... </p><p>Flash! </p><p>Light poured down from the sky. It was a light only aimed at Grid, but it was so bright that all of Reinhardt turned white. </p><p>Grid pulled out Defying the Natural Order. He glared at the being who had dropped to the ground one step ahead of the light hitting the ground. </p><p>“”Overgeared God Grid.”” </p><p>It was Metatron. They looked very different from the angels that people had imagined and witnessed so far. They had a beautiful body and face, but also an angular face and large body. They were spreading 18 pairs of wings to match their large body. </p><p>That’s right. People noticed at a glance that Metatron had a total of 36 wings. </p><p>Now Metatron was spreading out all their wings. It was a state of complete liberation. It was completely different from when they met Grid the other day. </p><p>“”This is God Judar’s message. Asgard’s target is Chiyou, and it doesn’t have the desire to antagonize the surface. Don’t provoke Asgard by building a fancy tower.”” </p><p>“......”</p><p>Asgard already knew about the tower and was on guard toward it. It meant that the tower raised by Eat Spicy Jokbal did have the potential to reach Asgard. Grid felt both displeasure and joy, but he didn’t say anything. </p><p>“”Additionally, this is my personal opinion. Overgeared God Grid. As you know, human beings are grateful to most gods. The same is true even though you now have a virtual monopoly on all human worship. Most gods are valuable only when remembered and talked about by humans.”” </p><p>There were many gods who were grateful just for being remembered... </p><p>Once again, Metatron’s attitude was clear. They were trying to convince Grid. <nfc0c3> Sᴇaʀᴄh the NøvᴇlFirᴇ(.)nᴇt website on Gøøglᴇ to access chapters of nøvels early and in the highest quality.</nfc0c3></p><p>“”Therefore, it is highly unlikely that the celestial gods will harm humans. Quit provoking and antagonizing Asgard. It is just a matter of useless anger.””</p><p>A beehive—the Asgard that Metatron referred to resembled a beehive. There were no benefits if it was poked. Grid found it hard to relate to these words. </p><p>“I think if we stay still, you will hit the surface in reverse.” </p><p>If the surface and Asgard didn’t intervene with each other, there would eventually be a god who would be forgotten. Asgard was at a one-sided disadvantage. The forgotten gods would become nervous and it wasn’t known what they would do. They could cause a disaster on the surface in order to imprint their existence onto people. </p><p>Metatron read Grid’s inner thoughts and shook their head. </p><p>“”The gods aren’t so simply forgotten. Humans are imperfect beings and are bound to feel despair in their lives. They will inevitably have a tendency to lean on something. The gods can survive simply by whispering a small oracle to them or extending a helping hand.””</p><p>“...In other words, is it right for humans to despair? I can see why you helped the demons when they invaded rather than helping people.” </p><p>“”You are making too much of a leap. But I don’t think it is wrong...”” </p><p>Metatron tilted their head and pondered on Grid’s words. Then they quickly came to a conclusion. </p><p>“”It is physiology.”” </p><p>“What?” </p><p>“”It is like the logic of nature. There is no reason to respond emotionally.””</p><p>“You have a knack for making words very unpleasant.” </p><p>“”There is one thing you should keep in mind.”” </p><p>The invader who called themselves a messenger—the angel in front of Grid, who stepped onto the surface without permission, was unpleasant in many ways. But Grid didn’t do a sword dance to stop Metatron from talking nonsense over and over again. It was because the energy waves coming from Metatron were so powerful. </p><p>A former archangel—the so-called ‘Angel of Contract’ usually had their arms, legs, eyes, ears, mouth, and wings sealed. </p><p>It was an attitude of treating Metatron as a dangerous object. But now all their wings were spread out. It wasn’t known what type of strong contract they signed, but they were in perfect condition. In fact, they easily broke down Reinhardt’s seal and arrived in front of Grid. </p><p>Strong... </p><p>It was a heavy burden to deal with Metatron in the middle of a city where so many people lived. </p><p>‘I guess this was what they were aiming for.’ </p><p>During the time when Grid’s expression distorted, additional assistance was arriving one after another. The soldiers and knights of the empire, as well as the apostles and Overgeared members, came from all directions. It was reassuring. It was different from the days when he didn’t like the support of his colleagues and ended up more anxious. </p><p>‘There are more means to protect the people.’ </p><p>They had been eating together for years. </p><p>Grid even knew how many spoons there were in Peak Sword’s house. Grid was familiar with his colleagues’ skills and could predict how they would use the current situation and terrain to protect the people. It meant he could trust in them and move. </p><p>“I wasn’t perfect at that time.” </p><p>Finally, Braham arrived at the scene. He slowly descended with a red glow in his eyes and emitted powerful waves from the magic power gathering in his hands, causing Metatron’s giant figure to vibrate slightly. In the midst of the heightened atmosphere— </p><p>“”The feelings you have for Asgard aren’t important.”” </p><p>Metatron warned. </p><p>“”What you should keep in mind is the danger of Chiyou. Your relationship with Asgard can’t be settled in any form as long as you can’t do anything about Chiyou. No matter what, Chiyou is heaven’s primary target.” </p><p>When they met in the past, Metatron had warned Grid to be careful of Chiyou. Of course, Grid let it enter one ear and go out the other. Metatron was a mere minion of the gods, while Chiyou had shown favor to Grid. Out of the two, the one that Grid should trust was naturally Chiyou. </p><p>“That is your situation.” </p><p>Grid finally moved. It was shortly after the soldiers and knights evacuated the people from the scene and he confirmed that the Overgeared Guild had built barriers at every street corner. It was a chance to tear apart and kill the invader in front of him, who kept talking nonsense... </p><p>Thinking about it differently, this was a great fortune. One of the strongest forces of heaven, who would’ve been a great enemy if they met in Asgard, walked in on their own. </p><p>Step. </p><p>It happened the moment when Grid’s steps were sublimated into a dance move... </p><p>“”It is too late.”” </p><p>Metatron frowned. </p><p>Grid also stopped moving. </p><p>Their gazes shifted to the same direction. </p><p>“”You shouldn’t have referred to yourself as the Martial God.””</p><p>Since when did he? Grid was choked up by this series of nonsense, but he didn’t reply. To be more precise, he couldn’t open his mouth. He was under tremendous pressure. Something great was coming... </p><p>There was the feeling of all the hairs on his body standing up. Sweat ran down the bridge of Grid’s nose as he gulped. </p><p>Braham and Zik noticed the situation one step later and also shifted their gazes.</p><p>“Are you finally able to replace me?” </p><p>Jingle. </p><p>The outrageous words were followed by the sound of bells. </p><p>“...Martial God.” </p><p>Chiyou—the true Martial God crossed the continent and arrived in front of Grid. </p><p>“”Loosen the constraints of the Overgeared World...!”” </p><p>Metatron’s urgent cry gradually faded away. It was the aftermath of being hit by the back of Chiyou’s blade and disappearing as a dot. </p><p>Grid recalled past memories. </p><p>-Don’t deal with Chiyou. There must be a reason why the Goddess turned away from him and sent him away. He might harm your hierarchy. </p><p>The intent that Metatron left behind the other day. It was etched in Grid’s mind again. </p><p>-Ignore it. Don’t associate with him. </p><p>It was a situation where it was clear that Metatron was absurd. </p><p>The angel’s warning—it should be treated like a dog was barking. But somehow, Grid couldn’t help listening to Metatron’s words. He saw through Chiyou’s essence. </p><p>A god who wanted to be destroyed—Chiyou existed only for himself without taking on any obligations. </p><p>He was wrong. Just because Chiyou didn’t harm humans, or gave Grid great power, didn’t mean Chiyou should be trusted. Chiyou seemed very satisfied with Grid’s wary attitude. </p><p>“Are you really going to replace me?” </p><p>In the first place, it was unlikely that a being who desired to die would have an intact mind. In fact, Grid knew it too. It was just that he maintained his goodwill with the vague belief that Chiyou wouldn’t threaten him. He shouldn’t have done that. </p><p>Just then, Chiyou trampled on the ground once and the skills and magic that the Overgeared Guild had deployed as barriers were disrupted. It shattered like glass. </p><p>“Are you judging phenomena or concepts as matter? No... did you just break it using sheer force?” </p><p>Braham’s voice, which was close to astonishment, plunged the Overgeared members still reeling from the unexpected turn of events into greater confusion.</p><p class="box-notification fs-17">Sᴇarch the <b>n0vᴇl(ꜰ)ire.ɴet</b> website on Gøøglᴇ to access chapters of nøvels early and in the highest quality.</p></div><h2>Chapter 1870</h2><div><p>Chapter 1869</p><p>Martial God Chiyou—he was the one who made Zik, who didn’t respect or revere the gods, bow his head on his own initiative. He was intense from the first impression and specially approached Grid. He gave Grid the right to take Chiyou's Test, despite not being a yangban, and bestowed a great favor upon Grid after he passed the ordeal. As a result, Grid unlocked his potential thanks to Chiyou and overcame his limitations several times. </p><p>“I’ve been watching you.” </p><p>In the first place, there was a sense of emotion from his eyes. Chiyou’s eyes were infinitely warm when he looked at Grid and Grid felt deep affection and gratitude. Regardless of his changed status, Grid deeply bowed his head. </p><p>“I also thought of you often. I'm relieved to see you in good spirits.” </p><p>“It is a great provocation.” </p><p>“......?” </p><p>The conversation between the two of them wasn’t transmitted to the outside world. </p><p>A colorless divinity—it was the aftermath of Chiyou’s divinity, which used the aspirations of all living things that craved power as its source, creating an invisible veil. It was a phenomenon created by Chiyou’s will to refuse to be worshiped. </p><p>The effect was great. The thousands or tens of thousands of people gathered because of Metatron—none of them had a good grasp of the current situation. </p><p>‘What type of conversation are they having?’ Chiyou looked blurry to everyone except for Grid. It definitely resembled a human form, but it felt like he was surrounded by fog. If Grid hadn’t mentioned the name Chiyou, they wouldn’t have even known who he was. </p><p>“...He is on the same side, right?” </p><p>The Overgeared Guild started to feel relieved. In fact, they had been somewhat intimidated by the sight of the giant angel called Metatron. </p><p>An angel with 18 pairs of wings. They even had a number of halos. The so-called halo of the angels. The angels in Satisfy could shrink or expand the halo, shooting beams or using it as a blade to brutally kill their targets. This meant that the more halos there were, the higher the probability of exerting great destructive power. </p><p>Just as they were worried that such a monster would go on a rampage in the middle of the city and cause great damage, Chiyou appeared. He blew Metatron, who was talking nonsense, all the way out of the city with a single blow, and Grid bowed in gratitude. It was natural to interpret him as an ally. </p><p>However, the situation inside the veil was going differently than what people thought. </p><p>“Even when you blocked Dominion’s spear.” </p><p>Jingle. </p><p>Chiyou’s bells were very sensitive. They cried just because Chiyou opened his mouth. </p><p>Grid belatedly noticed. He hadn’t known because it had been hidden by the collar and sleeves. There were several bells hanging from Chiyou’s body. </p><p>“Even when you defeated the apostle of the God of the Beginning, who had lost the god she served and was wandering.” </p><p>Jingle. </p><p>Grid took a step back. He suddenly realized why Chiyou had so many bells hanging from his body. </p><p>“Even when you received an apology from the Fire Dragon .” </p><p>Jingle. </p><p>“I rarely felt the limits of my patience.” </p><p>The bells were consideration. It was consideration for those trying to hurt him. </p><p>I am here. Don’t miss me. Point the sword at me properly. </p><p>“I wanted to run to you right away and point your sword at my neck.” </p><p>Jingle jingle. </p><p>The sound of bells gradually became louder. It was because Chiyou started walking. His steps were slow yet fast as he approached. They might be ordinary strides, but the distance between the two of them was too short. Grid wasn’t given enough time to think. </p><p>“But I endured it. I judged that if I urged you, who was tired from going through trials every time, it would increase the odds of things going wrong.” </p><p>The words were strangely twisted. </p><p>Grid noticed it. Chiyou didn’t feel any affection for him. He was just waiting patiently with consideration to achieve his own purpose. That was it, but Grid arbitrarily interpreted and misunderstood Chiyou’s favor. <nf809f> S~ᴇaʀᴄh the NøvᴇlFirᴇ(.)nᴇt website on Gøøglᴇ to access chapters of nøvels early and in the highest quality.</nf809f></p><p>There was something called common sense. But now he had to admit it. The existence in front of him was far from common sense. He just did things for his own sake. In other words, he was also a selfish being who did favors for others in order to ‘die.’ </p><p>“When you finally killed Baal.” </p><p>Jingle jingle jingle! </p><p>The sound of the bells started to ring like crazy. It was a loud noise created by the action of entering through Grid’s gap and slowly drawing a sword. </p><p>“I thought it was worth the wait.” </p><p>“......”</p><p>“And now, at last, the moment has come to finally put an end to it.” </p><p>You shouldn’t have referred to yourself as the Martial God... </p><p>Grid pondered on Metatron’s cry, which he had dismissed as nonsense. When he came out of the tower, people called him the Martial God. </p><p>Grid had taken it lightly. It was a natural response. However, the existence of Chiyou shouldn’t be overlooked. At the very least, Grid shouldn’t have forgotten the weight of the title ‘Martial God.’ </p><p>Of course, it was unfair. </p><p>‘Who would consider such a thing as foreshadowing?’ </p><p>Still, regret meant nothing. Even if he had prevented people from mentioning the Martial God, the result would’ve been the same. Chiyou would surely stand in front of Grid at some point. If he was targeted by Chiyou just because he pretended to be the Martial God, Zeratul would’ve already been killed by Chiyou hundreds of times... </p><p>Chiyou’s chilly-looking long sword revealed its full appearance. Grid saw his expression reflected on the blade and suddenly looked up at the sky. It occurred to him that all the heavenly gods must be watching this place right now. </p><p>Loosen the constraints of the Overgeared World... </p><p>He realized what Metatron’s last cry meant. It meant giving the heavenly gods the right to set foot on the surface. </p><p>‘Asgard is seriously intent on fighting Chiyou.’ </p><p>Asura had also said it. What the heavenly gods wanted from him was for him to fight against Chiyou. </p><p>‘Is there any chance of winning?’ </p><p>It was a useless question. No matter how skilled, even Chiyou wouldn’t be able to endure when withstanding a pincer attack from the gods of Asgard. Then he became curious about something else. </p><p>Why did Chiyou bother to visit him? </p><p>“...If you have been watching me, you know about Asura as well.” </p><p>“The Evil God that Baal gave birth to. He went up to Asgard.” </p><p>“He has the energy of a God Killer. If you really want to be destroyed, wouldn’t it be easier for you to confront the gods of Asgard rather than me?” </p><p>“You haven’t grasped the essence yet.” Chiyou shook his head. “The gods of Asgard can’t extinguish me.” </p><p>“It is the same for me...” </p><p>“No, you are the Martial God that humanity thinks of.” </p><p>“......”</p><p>“Only you can destroy me and replace me. It is something I’ve only recently learned.” </p><p>Thump. </p><p>Grid received a shock like his heart was being destroyed. It was because he realized that all his efforts made the current results. The stronger he got and the more new achievements he got, the more he was acknowledged by the people. </p><p>Naturally, he was faced with the fate of confronting Chiyou. It felt like he had been caught in a net without him knowing it. It was more painful and sad than unpleasant. </p><p>“However, in order for you to extinguish and replace me, you must fulfill one precondition.” </p><p>First of all, Grid liked Chiyou. </p><p>‘The bigger problem is—’ </p><p>It was because Chiyou was too strong. </p><p>“You have to fight me and win in front of everybody.” </p><p>“......”</p><p>Grid, who had been patient so far, frowned for the first time. By what means did he have to fight him and win? Chiyou was a special being among the gods. He was an existence where he couldn’t help mentioning the inherent differences. </p><p>Grid fighting against Chiyou and winning? It was a bug. It was the wrong worldview. It was impossible to win. Grid quickly came to a conclusion and was about to reject it. </p><p>“Of course, you will lose today.” </p><p>Chiyou told the truth. He proved that he wasn’t crazy. </p><p>“But it will provide you with plenty of experience. As always, you will use defeat as nourishment to grow further. After repeating this, you will surely tear my heart and soul apart.” </p><p>Don’t deal with him. </p><p>He is an absurd guy. </p><p>He might harm your hierarchy. </p><p>Etc etc. </p><p>Grid remembered Metatron’s warning. That’s right. Putting aside his desire to prove that Chiyou wasn’t crazy, Chiyou was starting to look crazy in Grid’s eyes. For once, defeat was fatal for Grid. He was also a god. There was a fear that his status would be seriously undermined if he was defeated in public. Chiyou’s proposal wasn’t realistic. </p><p>It was the moment when Grid was about to refuse again... </p><p>“You can’t veto it.” Chiyou drove in the nail. He also gave advice. “Focus on the sound of bells. Even if your eyes miss me, let the tip of your sword chase the sound.” </p><p>‘This damn thing.’ </p><p>In fact, if he thought about it in a composed manner, there was a high probability that Chiyou was the most distorted person in the world. An existence who only yearned for death couldn’t be normal—in the first place, most transcendents were crazy so it was a shameless wish to hope that Chiyou wouldn’t be crazy. </p><p>‘I must avoid being defeated by a landslide...’ </p><p>Grid sensed that a fight was inevitable and activated the White Tiger’s Posture. His goal was to increase his resistance and increase the chance to withstand Chiyou’s attack. </p><p>Chiyou shook his head. “Didn’t I say that it is only meaningful if it is you?” </p><p>“.....!” </p><p>Grid’s face was filled with astonishment. </p><p>[Martial God Chiyou has neutralized ‘White Tiger’s Posture Engulfed in Flames.’] </p><p>Skill cancellation—it was a power that Chiyou naturally used. </p><p>“Only the power that is your source can damage my status.” </p><p>“No...” </p><p>In that case, wasn’t even the sword dance meaningless because Pagma was its source? Grid was about to say something in a flustered manner, only to close his mouth. It wasn’t because of Chiyou. </p><p>[An unauthorized being has entered the Overgeared World.] </p><p>It was only when the back of a white-haired giant blocked Grid’s view that a notification window rose up. The system only recognized it belatedly because the intruder was so fast. </p><p>Rattle. </p><p>The noise of heavy chains sweeping on the ground was just as loud as the sound of Chiyou’s bells. </p><p>“...Zeratul?” </p><p>Grid noticed the identity of the white-haired giant and was flustered because he couldn’t understand what was going on.</p><p>“I am the Martial God,” the giant declared. “Specter who still believes himself to be the Martial God. You have been disqualified from the moment you left your responsibilities long ago. Engrave the name of the new Martial God on those rotten ears. I am Zeratul.”</p><p class="box-notification fs-17">Sᴇarch the <b>NƟvelFɪre.ɴet</b> website on Gøøglᴇ to access chapters of nøvels early and in the highest quality.</p></div><h2>Chapter 1871</h2><div><p>Chapter 1870</p><p>At Asgard... </p><p>The only interest of the gods gathered in the great hall was Chiyou.

This time, it wasn’t Grid’s fault. Grid was facing Chiyou on the surface. </p><p>“Tell me.” </p><p>The gods summoned a certain angel and questioned him. </p><p>“Why did you open the lock?” </p><p>“By what authority did a mere angel use to set the prisoner free?” </p><p>The angel named by the gods as the culprit—he was particularly delicate and had a strange side to him. The halo above his head didn’t glow brightly, but changed colors from moment to moment. Every time the color changed, the energy it gave off also changed. So it was like one, but also many. He was silently dragged to be questioned by the gods and replied with a cocked head, “Magic is the power to give value to something that is worthless.” </p><p>That was it. It was as if this was enough of an answer. The angel said this and shut his mouth. </p><p>Some gods were making a fuss. They didn’t understand. There was even a god who shouted for the angel to answer properly. </p><p>‘It is sincere.’ </p><p>It happened the moment when the angel was disappointed... </p><p>“My thoughts are also in agreement with you.” </p><p>Judar, who was silent in the corner as if he had no interest in the situation, suddenly spoke. </p><p>The God of Wisdom—he was one of the few beings who could read the heart of the arrogant angel. </p><p>“Well done.” </p><p>It was rare for Judar to give praise, and his congratulatory message silenced the crowd. The other gods could no longer hold the angel accountable. </p><p>***</p><p>A white beard that descended down to his abdomen and gray hair that waved like thunderbolts. Eyes that emitted a white light due to the pupils that blurred as the eyes rose. With his solid body and massive features, Zeratul’s appearance was overwhelming in many ways. It was the very image of the Martial God that people imagined. But now he was different. </p><p>Rattle rattle. </p><p>How heavy was it? Zeratul’s limbs were restrained with chains of unimaginable weight and he looked shabby compared to the past. </p><p>Nearly bushy hair and an uncombed beard. Crumpled, dusty clothes. He wasn’t even wearing a top and was half-naked. Above all, the shackles on his hands and feet showed how bad his condition was. </p><p>However, Zeratul’s expression was the same as in the past. He looked arrogant as if he was the only special one. </p><p>“You... how did you escape from prison?” </p><p>Grid was momentarily taken aback. He couldn’t understand the situation in front of him and asked a question. Had he escaped his prisoner status? That was what he thought at first, but it wasn’t the case. </p><p>Zeratul’s appearance hadn’t changed at all from when they met in the Prison of Eternity. Zeratul didn’t even look at Grid. He answered while still glaring at Chiyou. “I was just led by fate.” </p><p>It was a bluff. The truth was different. </p><p>Mumud? The angel who was considered a candidate for an archangel even though he was born a human—Zeratul had guessed what he intended by unlocking the prison. </p><p>‘It is more of an act of taking out the garbage.’ </p><p>Mumud knew what Zeratul would be obsessed with if he gained his freedom in his current situation. Mumud’s intentions were clear. </p><p>‘He wants to guess Chiyou’s martial ability through me.’ </p><p>Mumud also would’ve hoped that the troublemaker was destroyed by Chiyou. </p><p>“...Kukuk.” </p><p>The chains entangled under Zeratul’s feet rose into the air like coiled snakes. It was the aftermath of Zeratul taking a starting posture. It was a stance with both hands empty. He intended to use the chains that bound him as a weapon. </p><p>“Behold the power of the true Martial God and tremble.” </p><p>Zeratul’s every word and actions were sincere. Of course, he knew that Chiyou was strong. He sensed in real time that Chiyou’s status overwhelmed his. But he didn’t shrink back. </p><p>A difference in status? It didn’t matter. Grid proved it by defeating him in the past when Grid had a lower status than him. Besides, he had accumulated enough discipline. He had honed his body and mind while in the Prison of Eternity. </p><p>It is definite. </p><p>The person I am now transcends the me of the past... </p><p>“Zeratul, are you going to die?” </p><p>Grid urgently asked Zeratul, who was muttering to himself without answering the question. Funnily enough, he was worried about Zeratul. It was because they built up quite a few ties. Of course— </p><p>From Grid’s perspective, Zeratul was close to a villain. He possessed talented people and used them like slaves. He even had a history of trying to harm the people important to Grid, including Lord. However, he didn’t hurt anyone in the end. He also recently helped Grid in the Prison of Eternity. Thanks to Zeratul, he was able to rescue Khan and Hexetia safely. </p><p>He knew it wasn’t from pure goodwill. Zeratul just hated Raphael more than Grid. He knew this, but... after all, wasn’t it a relationship? </p><p>Zeratul had already paid enough for his sins. He was defeated by Grid in front of everyone watching and was reduced to the status of a prisoner. Grid’s grudge against Zeratul had long faded. Additionally, he was once again receiving Zeratul’s help right now. It came as a one-sided favor. </p><p>Zeratul read Grid’s heavily sunken mind and frowned. “Fool. Don’t misunderstand.” </p><p>Zeratul had lost a lot of his divinity. He was unable to even build weapons out of divinity, so he honed the art of using chains as weapons. It was a very shabby-looking technique, but Zeratul was confident. It was because he knew the value of skills honed through effort. He learned it through Grid. </p><p>“I’m just fighting for myself. You don’t need to feel emotional about this.” </p><p>Zeratul didn’t wish to speak further. He immediately flew to destroy Chiyou’s face, which remained indifferent even when facing him. </p><p>The clash of Martial God against Martial God—it was a major incident that shook the world. </p><p>The apostles and the Overgeared members held their breath. However, Sword Saint Muller, who was watching the situation from a distance, wasn't interested in what was about to unfold. </p><p>‘The difference in power is clear.’ </p><p>It was the same for Grid. They rightly predicted Zeratul’s defeat and the result was more disastrous than they expected. </p><p>Thump. </p><p>Chiyou didn’t even draw his sword. The simple movement of stepping on the ground with his feet suppressed Zeratul’s charging power. On the other hand, he used a relaxed hand movement, like when he previously spread out the veil, to grab Zeratul’s neck and slam him into the ground. </p><p>“I think that among Rebecca’s works, the ones somewhat worth acknowledging are this land, the World Tree, and Judar.” </p><p>Chiyou didn’t pay attention to Zeratul even at the last moment. He didn’t even look at Zeratul flinching in shock, and only looked at Grid. </p><p>“The best of them is this land that gave birth to you. Your existence has increased the value of the surface.” </p><p>That was the end of the waiting. </p><p>Chiyou tightened his grip on Zeratul’s neck. The eerie sound of crushing bones brought silence to the scene. </p><p>Something in the form of a human being—Martial God Chiyou’s force, which wasn’t properly recognized by others, except for Grid, was overwhelming. He carved the word despair into the world just by pulling out his sword and pointing it at Grid. </p><p>Just then, the tip of Chiyou’s sword tilted forward at an angle. It was the aftermath of being pulled by the chains that wrapped around the blade of the sword in an instant. It was a result created by Grid. </p><p>[By your own authority, you have defined ‘Zeratul’ as a guest, not an intruder.] </p><p>The constraints of the Overgeared World—the dimensional constraints that had oppressed Zeratul from the time he descended to the surface had dissipated. It was just like when Grid met him in the Prison of Eternity. </p><p>At this moment, Zeratul was in an intact state. There were obvious flaws compared to the days when he reigned as the Martial God. But at the very least, this was ‘Zeratul’s most powerful state’ that Grid remembered. </p><p>“I...!” </p><p>Chiyou’s upper body leaned forward. For the first time, he made eye contact with Zeratul, who pulled himself to his feet. </p><p>“Am the Martial God...!!” </p><p>The form of the noise was complicated. It was because Zeratul raised himself and had many different ways of using chains. The chains binding his wrists and ankles moved very naturally. They repeated the actions of binding Chiyou’s sword and body, and beating and throwing them according to Zeratul’s will. </p><p>“It is this much...?” </p><p>Muller was impressed. The depth and speed of the technique that utilized chains—both were flawless. Thanks to this, the more the technique was linked, the more the power was infinitely amplified... </p><p>It happened the moment when Muller, dazzled by Zeratul’s unexpected technique, reflected on Zeratul’s title as the Martial God... </p><p>“It isn’t trivial,” Chiyou said as his limbs were restrained by chains and he was strangled. For the first time, the person he was talking about was Zeratul, not Grid. </p><p>“How wonderful.” </p><p>The reason why Chiyou readily admitted it was that he was reminded of the background of Zeratul’s birth. The existence created by Rebecca to replace him—it meant he was a masterpiece that a lot of care was put into. It was right that he should be great. </p><p>“It just isn’t enough.” </p><p>The chains that held Chiyou shattered in unison. Thanks to this, it wasn’t only Chiyou, but Zeratul too was freed from his restraints. However, in this situation, this wasn’t an advantage. For Zeratul, who had been honing the chains as weapons, he had lost his weapon. </p><p>“The qualification is still with Grid.” </p><p>A colorless sword energy rose. It was too strong for Zeratul, who had lost his weapon and was empty-handed, to resist. This would cut him no matter what. </p><p>Zeratul’s intuition sent a chill down his spine. He thought of the future where he would be defeated and weakened again under the watchful eyes of everyone. </p><p>Fate had just been decided. A fate bestowed by the Only One God. A fate that couldn’t be resisted.</p><p>“Zeratul!” </p><p>Grid twisted it. </p><p>The fate bestowed by the Only One God no longer had coercive power from the time when Zeratul received Defying the Natural Order, the ‘power Grid used as the source’ mentioned by Chiyou, which had been desperately thrown by Grid. </p><p>“......!” </p><p>Chiyou, who had longed for extinction—his eyes, which had lost their light while dreaming of distant ideals, regained their vitality after eons. It was due to Zeratul, who wielded Grid’s Defying the Natural Order in his capacity as the Martial God. </p><p>“......” </p><p>Zeratul’s expression was complicated. It was a situation where he escaped death thanks to the sword thrown by Grid. He wondered if he was declaring himself as ‘Grid’s Martial God.’ </p><p>It felt like he was putting on new shackles.</p><p class="box-notification fs-17">Sᴇarch the <b>NʘvᴇlFɪre.ɴet</b> website on Gøøglᴇ to access chapters of nøvels early and in the highest quality.</p></div><h2>Chapter 1872</h2><div><p>Chapter 1871</p><p>At the time when the presumed Chiyou created a strange atmosphere, Zeratul suddenly burst in and started fighting with his back to Grid. </p><p>I am the Martial God. I am the one who is the Martial God. </p><p>He was definitely out of his mind based on the way he was repeating the same thing over and over again. At first glance, his attitude of fighting while protecting Grid was bizarre. </p><p>Zeratul had previously threatened Grid many times. The Overgeared members decided that they shouldn’t take the situation happening in front of them at face value. They were wary of both the presumed Chiyou and Zeratul and watched for an opportunity to rescue Grid. </p><p>At this moment— </p><p>“Zeratul!” </p><p>Grid threw his sword toward Zeratul. To be exact, he handed it over. At least for the moment, Zeratul was an ally. </p><p>It was hard to believe. For a moment, they suspected that Grid was possessed by a ghost. However, they were soon convinced. Wasn’t Grid someone who took even Evil Dragon Bunhelier as a companion? It was concluded that it was likely Zeratul, not Grid, who was possessed. No matter what happened, it meant that Zeratul was recognized as an ally. </p><p>“Weapon Enchant! Purification!” </p><p>Ruby started to assist Zeratul. She tried to stop the bleeding while giving him all types of buff magic. At the same time, she poured out heals. There was no effect. </p><p>The thin film that couldn’t be seen—it surrounded Grid, Zeratul, and Chiyou and blocked all external interference. </p><p>“My magic doesn’t work.” Braham frowned. </p><p>Martial God Chiyou—the Only One God that even the Gods of the Beginning couldn’t do anything against. He was overwhelming. He had the power to make his will take precedence over any concept. The magic used against him would never reach the point of creating a miracle. </p><p>‘Or is there another way? Mumud.’ </p><p>Braham was noticing the ‘magic power’ that was buried in Zeratul. A being who made him feel shameful emotions such as jealousy and guilt—when it came to magic, Mumud was the most gifted human of all time. His magic power was unrivaled. It was so mysterious and intense that Braham naturally became obsessed with it. It was impossible for Braham to forget it. </p><p>Braham was convinced that Mumud’s intervention was behind Zeratul’s incursion to the surface. </p><p>“......?” </p><p>Braham’s eyes widened as he examined the situation. </p><p>The magic power that was buried in Zeratul—it was mere remnants. It wasn’t even a sign of direct magic on Zeratul. Perhaps Mumud’s magic destroyed the prison where Zeratul was imprisoned and in the process, a glimmer of magic power was smeared on Zeratul. The remnants of Mumud’s magic power were weak enough to form this speculation. </p><p>However, the remnants were combining together were taking on the form of magic. Someone was targeting it in real time and trying something—it was Euphemina. </p><p>[The magic power of an unknown person is contemplating you.] </p><p>[An unknown person is viewing your level, stats, and list of magic you have acquired.] </p><p>“......!” </p><p>Euphemina unexpectedly exposed herself. Even in this sudden situation, she figured out what was going on. According to common sense, the only one who could contemplate her without her permission was Mumud. </p><p>‘Mumud. The source of my magic... he must be existing as an angel. It will be greatly difficult if we meet someday.’ </p><p>Recently, Euphemina had been suffering from tremendous fatigue. It was because unlike others, she didn’t have time to enjoy the top content. She was busy chasing Betty and Agnus’ trails. </p><p>The former Baal’s Contractors—Euphemina had no doubt that they would be alive and well somewhere, and Grid’s thoughts coincided with hers. Betty had said she would perish together with Baal the moment Baal died. However, no one had confirmed her death. She disappeared with Agnus shortly before Baal was killed by Grid. </p><p>Grid pinned his hopes on this part. He asked Euphemina, who had a history of chasing Agnus in the past, to find the two of them. Euphemina wandered all over the continent and returned to Reinhardt with accumulated fatigue. She rushed over the moment she heard there was an emergency. </p><p>The result was this. Her identity was discovered by Mumud and she was dissected in detail. She was worried that this would snowball into a big problem later. She was inwardly anxious when Braham approached her and whispered, “There is no need to worry. I will be his opponent.” </p><p>Braham’s magic destroyed Mumud’s magic that was dissecting Euphemina. </p><p>“...Hmm.” </p><p>The heavenly angel admired it. The halo with various colors like a rainbow took the form of an exclamation mark for a moment. </p><p>‘It is the God of Wisdom and Magic.’ </p><p>Braham, a god apotheosized on the surface like Grid—he had as many as two modifiers. Mumud became increasingly interested and was able to check his skills. </p><p>Dimension and destruction—he hadn’t expected Braham to instantly identify and destroy the magic that worked secretly across a distance that was physically difficult to estimate. Mumud thought he would learn a lot if they ever had a chance to compete in skills one day. </p><p>“The constraints of the Overgeared World have been weakened, right?” </p><p>The angel was deep in thought, only for his expression to stiffen. It was due to the one who interrupted him. He bumped into Venice, the God of Money. </p><p>“Angel Mumud. There was a reason why God Judar protected you.” </p><p>Magic is the power to give value to something that is worthless... </p><p>This was the argument that Mumud made before the gods for releasing Zeratul from prison. By worthless, he naturally meant Zeratul. A being that, if left unchecked, would’ve rotted away senselessly in the Prison of Eternity. </p><p>However, Zeratul gained value the moment Mumud’s magic unlocked the prison. The proof was that the constraints of the Overgeared World had weakened. </p><p>Only One God Grid—Mumud heard he was very obsessed with connections, but he actually welcomed Zeratul as a guest in the Overgeared World? If Zeratul showed a bit more here, he could even reveal Chiyou’s strength. </p><p>“You are several times more capable than the archangel, who is still sucking their fingers in hell. Isn’t that why you are going to be an archangel one day?” </p><p>“I’m not interested.” </p><p>The angel Mumud resolutely shook his head. </p><p>“Even if Raphael is impeached, Metatron will regain their position and fill the vacancy.” </p><p>Metatron—they showed disgrace by leaving the battlefield in the aftermath of allowing a single attack from Chiyou to hit them. Their current location was in the far east. It was hundreds of kilometers from Reinhardt. However, Mumud was aware of Metatron’s power. It was assumed that Metatron stepped back for a while to arrange some variables. </p><p>“Hey, from what I have seen, the former archangel isn’t very reliable either.” </p><p>“It is more ridicule than necessary.” </p><p>“......?” </p><p>“It goes beyond mere distrust and is interpreted as an attempt to incite dissension. Do you want to be part of the Overgeared World? Or maybe you are already...” </p><p>“A mere angel is doubting a god?” </p><p>Venice’s inner thoughts were stabbed and she became angry in reverse. Mumud saw her trying to be calm and shook his head. </p><p>“No matter what, it doesn’t matter. Whatever your intentions, the trend won’t be affected.”</p><p>“......” </p><p>In his past life and in this life, Mumud was infinitely close to goodness. However, he had the self-righteousness and arrogance that was unique to talented people. This was one of the reasons why Braham of the past couldn’t help being jealous of him. </p><p>***</p><p>“It is a wonderful interpretation.” </p><p>Defying the Natural Order—it was Grid’s masterpiece. It contained the knowledge, skills, connections, and willpower that Grid had accumulated. </p><p>The filth of the Four Auspicious Beasts wasn’t mixed in with it. It was a power that purely took Grid as its source. In other words, it was the only concept that threatened Chiyou. It didn’t have to be handled directly by Grid. </p><p>“Every single one of the countless works you have made is qualified to bring me down. They are weapons to annihilate me.” </p><p>He was like a man standing in a daze in the pouring rain. Chiyou’s eyes, which had been out of focus, found a clear focus. The colorless veil that didn’t allow outside interference was lifted. </p><p>His hands drooped as he looked at Grid, Defying the Natural Order, Zeratul, and all the apostles and Overgeared members who owned works made by Grid. He started to harbor transcendent anticipation as he held a dark-colored sheath in his left hand and a rusty long sword showing the weight of the years in his right hand. </p><p>“Come.” </p><p>The group that fought and defeated the Absolute beings like Baal, Asura, and King Daebyeol and liberated hell—Chiyou declared toward the strongest Overgeared Guild led by Grid. It was an attitude that seemed to be making concessions rather than shrinking back. </p><p>At this point, the Overgeared Guild were in a frenzy. Like those who fell for the provocation, they deployed their skills and targeted Chiyou. However, an unexpected variable arose. </p><p>“......!”</p><p>“......?!” </p><p>Zeratul, who was right at the forefront of the flow—he swung his sword in the direction he chose. It was toward the Overgeared God’s Temple in the distance. The powerful sword energy split apart the figure of Grid standing tall in front of the temple. </p><p>“Are you crazy?” </p><p>“I shouldn’t have trusted you...!” </p><p>What was this nonsense all of a sudden? Damian and Huroi were particularly furious. Instead of running toward Chiyou, they shifted directions and surrounded Zeratul. </p><p>Meanwhile, a notification window emerged in Grid’s vision. </p><p>[Zeratul has destroyed your image and blasphemed your divinity. The Overgeared World defines him as an intruder.] </p><p>The reason why Grid accepted Zeratul as a guest was to free him from the constraints of the Overgeared World. However, he voluntarily took on the constraints again. Why? </p><p>Zeratul’s thoughts trickled into Grid’s bewildered mind. </p><p>-Don’t be blinded by the opponent in front of you and give excuses to external enemies. </p><p>Zeratul broke through the siege of Damian and Huroi and threw himself forward, colliding with Chiyou. Once again, he was at the forefront. However, it was under constraints. </p><p>Power, speed, and even status—Zeratul wasn’t able to fully confront Chiyou. Every time they exchanged blows, the number of wounds on his body increased. However, Defying the Natural Order was shining. Every time Zeratul slashed Chiyou once in return for dozens of cuts, Chiyou also shed red blood. </p><p>-Despite all of this, my affiliation is still Asgard. If you loosen my constraints, the bastards of Asgard will also be freed from the constraints of the Overgeared World. </p><p>“...Why?” </p><p>Grid stared blankly at the back of Zeratul, who was finally collapsing. </p><p>“Why do you care about me?” </p><p>Grid expressed the question that had blossomed in the depths of his heart. It was a situation where he was threatened by someone he had trusted and admired, while conversely, he was helped by someone he had hated. Grid was already confused by this situation and was deeply disturbed by Zeratul’s subtle attitude. He was frustrated and wanted to know why. </p><p>Zeratul snorted. </p><p>-Didn’t I warn you not to be mistaken? Don’t interpret my intentions as goodwill. I just hate those condescending bastards in heaven more than you, and I fight purely for myself. </p><p>The Prison of Eternity—even when Grid stormed into this place a little while ago, Zeratul’s attitude was the same. He didn’t break, just like a sword made by Grid. </p><p>Grid was fascinated. He was instinctively driven. </p><p>“I think I like people like you.” </p><p>-What? Crazy guy...? </p><p>Zeratul reacted with extreme disgust, but Grid didn’t care. </p><p>“Request to Stand With Me.” </p><p>He retrieved all the weapons from his comrades, who were rushing like moths to the fire toward Chiyou. He took one step forward, then two. He stared intently at the back of Zeratul, who was blocking Chiyou’s sword with Defying the Natural Order, which Zeratul barely straightened. Just as he had good feelings toward the object he hated, he harbored hostility toward the object he admired. </p><p>“If you want to die, then die.” </p><p>It was raining. It was a rain of metal. Each one was a force that took Grid as its source, just like Defying the Natural Order. <nf7be4> Sᴇaʀch* Thᴇ N0vᴇlFire(.)nᴇt website on Gøøglᴇ to access chapters of nøvels early and in the highest quality.</nf7be4></p><p>A smile spread across Chiyou’s face.</p><p class="box-notification fs-17">Sᴇarch the <b>N0vᴇlFire(.)nᴇt</b> website on Gøøglᴇ to access chapters of nøvels early and in the highest quality.</p></div><h2>Chapter 1873</h2><div><p>“Your attack was a throw. Contrary to your ambitious words, your attitude is flawed.”</p><p>The words spoke the conclusion—</p><p>Grid’s rain of battle gear had no effect. The tens of thousands of weapons rained down like torrential rain, but they couldn’t even touch even the tip of Chiyou’s hair. In a way, it was natural. Defying the Natural Order was wielded by Zeratul, who was briefly freed from the constraints of the Overgeared World.Even this sword, which shot faster than a beam of light, couldn’t cut Chiyou properly.</p><p>It was unreasonable to expect that the ranged wide area skill, which was slower than Grid’s sword that was directly wielded, would hurt Chiyou. No, he honestly was expecting it. The strength of the rain of battle gear lay in the fact that it was a wide area skill. It was somewhat slow, but it pressured the opponent with range. It induced limitations in evasion and blocking.</p><p>However, Chiyou swung his sword once, as gracefully as if painting with a brush, and made all the attack trajectories of the battle gear miss.</p><p>‘It isn’t a matter of slow or fast.’</p><p>Nor was it the domain of technique.</p><p>‘Power.’</p><p>But what power was it? Was he simply immune to projectiles? The problem with that interpretation was that he responded by swinging his sword.</p><p>The battle gear that filled Grid’s field of view for a moment—they returned to their respective masters without achieving their purpose and Chiyou’s sword stuck out through the gap. It was very natural, as if it was one of the weapons made by Grid. It was fair to say that it permeated the landscape.</p><p>“......?”</p><p>Thus, there was a momentary gap before Grid recognized the attack. The warning sent by his artificial senses was overshadowed and he failed to respond for a moment.</p><p>Claaaang!</p><p>Then he felt rewarded again for raiding Baal. It was because the Demon Sword Remnants blocked Chiyou’s sword on Grid’s behalf. Yes, it was definitely blocked.</p><p>[You have suffered 5,129,100 damage.]</p><p>[’Doran’s Ring’ has immediately restored half of the lost health.]</p><p>“......?”</p><p>Fresh blood gushed from Grid’s chest. It was the aftermath of being slashed by Chiyou’s sword that passed through Demon Sword Remnants. The pain that had previously only been felt at the moment of death unexpectedly struck and made Grid’s mind flash. He hesitated while trying to return the damage he had suffered.</p><p>“You deserve it, I know.”</p><p>‘It passed through the demon sword like an illusion.’</p><p>“But that alone won’t convince the world. You need to cut my throat with your own sword to disqualify me.”</p><p>‘Don’t tell me.’</p><p>Grid realized it. Chiyou’s power was probably to induce a ‘pure confrontation.’ Chiyou neutralized other people’s skills and magic without touching it, he simply broke through the pouring rain of battle gear and turned the Demon Sword Remnants useless. It was because Chiyou’s power didn’t recognize such situations as ‘fights.’</p><p>“Of course, the idea of using that was good.”</p><p>Chiyou’s eyes fell on Zeratul in the distance. Zeratul’s appearance was disastrous. His right arm was severed and he was biting Defying the Natural Order with his mouth like a beast. He crawled for around five meters before managing to raise himself up. He was covered with blood.</p><p>After being restricted by the Overgeared World again, he was completely overwhelmed by Chiyou. However, he wasn’t shabby. Zeratul fought as best as he could and caused a small amount of injuries on Chiyou’s body. This was the reason why Chiyou’s ink-colored dopo, which stretched long like a spider, was torn and ripped everywhere.</p><p>“The Martial God made by Rebecca. When I saw you charging at me, I judged you to be a worthless defective product, but reality is different. However, it isn’t enough. He isn’t worthy of being your agent.”</p><p>“......”</p><p>Zeratul was approaching. Due to the constraints of the Overgeared World, the regeneration of his severed arm was slow and his shattered knee was still rattling, but he tried not to waste time. Maybe he knew it from the beginning. The only way to fight Chiyou was to bump into him directly. It was an expression of trying to settle things somehow before Defying the Natural Order was taken away by Grid.</p><p>“Nevertheless, I am giving you another chance.”</p><p>Grid’s attitude of silently watching the approaching Zeratul disappointed Chiyou.</p><p>Seeing him frowning, Grid thought again. ‘It was the same with Rebecca and Yatan.’</p><p>There was a sense of humanity in the high gods. The emotions expressed through their facial expressions were easy to understand because they were like humans.</p><p>Rebecca’s distorted smile, Yatan’s bitter expression that he had seen in the past, and Chiyou’s distorted face in front of him reminded him of the fact that they were far from ‘perfect.’ Grid took a deep breath.</p><p>He decided not to worry about it. It was a bit absurd to say in this situation, but Chiyou wasn’t an enemy. The traces of destruction left on the streets proved it. No one was injured or killed by Chiyou. Even the collapsed buildings had one thing in common and it was that they were completely deserted.</p><p>Only Grid and Zeratul were cut by Chiyou’s sword.</p><p>‘This is just a test.’</p><p>From Chiyou’s perspective, it was a life-or-death test, but from Grid’s perspective, it was just a test that came out of nowhere. There was no need to panic. Even if he didn’t necessarily aim for the best result, there was no hindrance to the general trend.</p><p>‘...Let’s think of the best scenario.’</p><p>Grid calmly analyzed the situation and laid down one premise.</p><p>First of all, there was no way to avoid fighting. Chiyou believed that Grid was qualified to take the test. The test ended only when the result was a victory or defeat.</p><p>‘It will be over if I just die.’</p><p>Even if he lost and failed, he didn’t think he would suffer a big penalty. In fact, this situation wasn’t even judged as a quest. There was no indication that any penalty would be incurred in the case of a failure.</p><p>Wasn’t it all about losing Chiyou’s favorability?</p><p>‘Additionally, Chiyou’s favorability has no effect.’</p><p>A special existence who only hoped for extinction—even if he built up favorability, it would only get him one more chance to kill Chiyou. However, Grid didn’t want a simple end to this situation. In any case, this was a rare situation. It was right to find a way to use it. That was the best thing he could do.</p><p>‘...Will it work?’</p><p>The time it took for Grid to come up with an idea was short. There were already so many hints that it was easy for his mind to work.</p><p>Glance.</p><p>Grid’s eyes met Lauel’s.</p><p>-I’m going to release the dimensional constraints.</p><p>-Do as you wish.</p><p>Lauel was someone who understood perfectly even when Grid was speaking nonsense. He immediately grasped Grid’s intentions and nodded. It was more like an attitude that he had been waiting.</p><p>That was enough. Grid was convinced that his judgment was correct and intervened in the dimensional system.</p><p>‘Stop the operation of the dimension effect.’</p><p>The dimensional effect of the Overgeared World was to suppress intruders from other dimensions. It didn’t work against Chiyou at all, but the gods who didn’t originally belong to the Overgeared World couldn’t exert their full power in the Overgeared World. It was the safety device responsible for the safety of the surface. However, at this moment—</p><p>[The dimensional effect of the Overgeared World has stopped.]</p><p>[The penalty that intruders receive from the Overgeared World has disappeared.]</p><p>The safeguard was lifted. Zeratul was the first to feel it. He was shocked as he challenged Chiyou again. “You, are you crazy...?!”</p><p>Zeratul shook off Chiyou and stared up at the sky. His trembling eyes shone with a brilliant light. They were colored by the light pouring from the sky.</p><p>“This...”</p><p>“...What a spectacle.”</p><p>The heavenly gods descended. There were hundreds of gods led by Dominion. In the past, Zeratul had a history of visiting the surface with the gods, but the scale of this procession was different.</p><p>“It is strange. Why would you give away your opportunity to other gods?”</p><p>As the completely overwhelmed people remained silent, Chiyou’s question rang out. His attitude of describing this situation as an opportunity spoke for itself. He really had no ill will toward Grid.</p><p>Grid smiled bitterly. “It is because I don’t have the ability to fight you and win yet.”</p><p>“...Anything is hard the first time.”</p><p>It is nice not to have to win.</p><p>Chiyou swallowed down his inner thoughts and turned away from Grid. In fact, he knew it deep down. It was impossible for Grid to kill him at once. However, if Grid learned from this ordeal, then he would gradually change the next time and the time after that. It was a waste of his expectations.</p><p>Grid’s attitude of meekly giving up disappointed Chiyou.</p><p>‘This is my fault. I shouldn’t have admired him.’</p><p>But he didn’t blame Grid. Chiyou blamed himself and shifted his attention to Dominion.</p><p>The God of War—the larger the group he led, the stronger Dominion became. As the scale of the fight grew, it was possible for him to gain the upper hand over Chiyou. In any case, it was just a theory. In past wars, Dominion had never been able to surpass Chiyou. Even if he went beyond Chiyou, he couldn’t kill Chiyou. It was because being defeated by a large number of enemies couldn’t undermine the qualifications of the Martial God.</p><p>“Chiyou... obediently come with me. I will escort you to the place where the Goddess is.”</p><p>[The gods of Asgard have descended to the surface.]</p><p>[Dominion, the God of War, is feared and respected by all.]</p><p>All the gods who descended to the surface had a great presence, but Dominion was the most prominent one among them. The shadow of the large army that existed beyond the golden clouds had reached the surface. Tens of thousands of hidden soldiers reacted to Dominion’s words and gestures, making the people hold their breath.</p><p>Everyone except for Grid and Lauel suffered from anxiety. It was a situation where an unbearably great foreign power stepped into the heart of the Empire.</p><p>“Stay calm.”</p><p>[The confusion of the soldiers has subsided.]</p><p>[The morale of the soldiers remains at the maximum.]</p><p>At the rear of the battlefield...</p><p>Prince Lord calmed down the noisy soldiers. He sent infinite trust and loyalty toward the great back of his father, who was far away.</p><p>It caught Chiyou’s interest, albeit slightly. “The concept of lineage often has an effect that is hard to ignore. But this isn’t always the case. In general, children of outstanding parents don’t meet the expectations of those around them.”</p><p>“Chiyou... you talk like a human being.”</p><p>“It must be the effect of watching over humans for a long time.”</p><p>It was after believing in Hanul’s promise and moving to the Hwan Kingdom. Chiyou didn’t intervene in the lives of humans, but watched them steadily. It was from the vague expectation that among those who grew up in an environment worthy of hating the gods, one of them would be qualified to kill a god.</p><p>He had observed more deeply after meeting Grid. It was because Grid lived with humans.</p><p>“In any case, you are the same. You are still worse than Rebecca.”</p><p>“There is no being comparable to the Goddess.”</p><p>The conversation was meaningless. If their conversation had any meaning , then their relationship would have come to a decisive end.</p><p>Dominion’s gesture was a signal. Dozens of gods attacked Chiyou. All types of powers worked in ways never imagined and destroyed the city.</p><p>The apostles, members of the Overgeared guild, and gods of the Overgeared World were busy. They were focused on reducing the extent of the destruction.</p><p>Grid watched the situation silently. It felt like it was an implicit rule not to intervene with the gods of Asgard. They became closer to a collaborator from the time the restrictions of the Overgeared World were released.</p><p>“In this state, the surface will be devastated. You should know that, right? What are you thinking?”</p><p>“......”</p><p>Grid didn’t respond to Zeratul, who was constantly scolding him. He just took back Defying the Natural Order.</p><p>“Kuek...”</p><p>Chiyou’s power was shining. He seemed to become more powerful in proportion to the strength of his opponents. The gods had their power destroyed by a single sword and started to suffer great wounds. Finally, some gods fell.</p><p>Just then, Grid moved. He shot like a thunderbolt and beheaded a fallen god.</p><p>The War of the Gods—a dirty thing happened in the holy war that should be endlessly sacred.</p><p>“......?”</p><p>“......?”</p><p>There was silence. Grid turned away from the eyes of the gods who didn’t understand the situation and whispered to Lauel.</p><p>-Is this right?</p><p>-It is really a wonderful example of letting the barbarians fight among themselves.</p><p>rainbowturtle's Thoughts</p><p>(3/4 weekly.)

However, Chiyou was obsessed with Grid. </p><p>‘I have no shame.’ </p><p>He would fight only when there was a chance of winning. What should he do to overcome this situation? The solution he came up with was surprisingly simple. </p><p>Metatron had hinted at it from the beginning. The heavenly gods were aiming for Chiyou. This was why Grid loosened the constraints of the Overgeared World. </p><p>The heavenly gods, who came down as if they had been waiting, targeted Chiyou and Chiyou could no longer be obsessed with Grid. </p><p>‘Now I can breathe a bit.’ </p><p>Martial God Chiyou—the Only One God’s power was beyond Grid’s imagination. There were many cases where dozens of gods wielding all types of powers were unable to inflict any injury despite unleashing a coordinated attack. </p><p>However, the composition of the battle wasn’t one-sided. It was because Dominion, the God of War, was balanced. The spear he wielded protected the other gods while carving wounds on Chiyou’s body. It was a neat spear technique without any frills. It possessed formidable power and suppressed the Martial God. </p><p>Grid was also overwhelmed. </p><p>‘There is something intuitively powerful about the combination of the huge presence and power of the spear.’ </p><p>He was certain that Dominion’s divinity was rising in real time right now. There were few people who would witness such a figure and not worship it. Additionally, Dominion’s spear unconditionally caused a multi-hit effect. Every time they collided with a target, the image of a huge spear fell from the sky and attacked the target several more times. </p><p>However, the fact that Chiyou was the target worked badly. Chiyou’s power was to induce a ‘pure confrontation.’ The added effect of Dominion’s attack had no effect on Chiyou. The moment the image of the spear touched Chiyou, it shattered like glass shards. All the wounds on Chiyou’s body were cuts and stabs from the spear wielded by ‘Dominion himself.’ </p><p>‘They are monsters.’ </p><p>Grid was convinced. The fact that in order to fight and win against them one day, he needed something other than force. </p><p>A mob beating. Yes, in vulgar terms, it was beating up one person as a group. </p><p>They weren’t the type of enemies he could fight one-on-one and win. </p><p>‘This is why the others need to become stronger.’ </p><p>In any case, Grid entered the realm of transcending himself and focused on the situation. He was able to breathe by encouraging the fight between Chiyou and the gods, but he couldn’t be satisfied with this much. The gods fighting among themselves ignored Grid. </p><p>When would he encounter this situation again? It was an opportunity that wouldn’t come twice. </p><p>Grid decided to take advantage of this opportunity. </p><p>“Keok...” The god, who was seriously injured and lying on the ground, had an incredulous look on his face. He alternately looked at the sword that pierced his heart and the face of Grid, who inserted the sword. </p><p>“How could you... shameless...”</p><p>“......!!” </p><p>The other gods were also agitated. The same was true of Chiyou. </p><p>“You shouldn’t have done this,” Chiyou lamented. It didn’t feel like a rebuke. He seemed worried about Grid. It was natural to be concerned. Now Grid had done something cowardly in front of everyone watching. Didn’t he incite the other gods to fight and take advantage of the opportunity to attack them? It wasn’t something that a great being should do. </p><p>“The worship of you will weaken...!” Finally, Sariel warned. It was advice. At the same time as the cry, the concerns of the gods once again shifted away from Grid. They heard the apostle’s warning and didn’t think Grid would do the same thing again. </p><p>‘It is a chance I will never get again.’ </p><p>Grid wasn’t the only one who saw this as an opportunity. Dominion also considered this situation where Chiyou was isolated as a unique opportunity. </p><p>A variable that wasn’t affected by the Goddess’ influence—in the past, the heavenly gods were unable to stop Chiyou from taking refuge with Hanul and experienced helplessness for the first time. They learned the concept of a disaster. They were obsessed with Chiyou because Asgard knew it couldn’t be perfect as long as Chiyou was alive. </p><p>The exception was Zeratul. Unlike the other gods, he couldn’t take his eyes off Grid. It was because he experienced firsthand that Grid’s specialty was making predictions go wrong. <nf1620> Sᴇaʀᴄh the NʘvᴇlFire.nᴇt website on Gøøglᴇ to access chapters of nøvels early and in the highest quality.</nf1620></p><p>‘He isn’t the type to listen to others.’ </p><p>It was as expected. </p><p>“Kuack!” Another god was seriously wounded by Chiyou and immediately beheaded by Grid. He was fatally injured in front of a large number of people. In return, his status was greatly damaged and he fled to heaven helplessly. </p><p>“...What are you doing?” Dominion couldn’t stand it any longer. He stopped the gods’ offensive with a heavy gesture and glared at Grid. “Isn’t this a loss for you as well?” </p><p>Even an Only One God wasn’t free from criticism. Chiyou was proving it right now. The reason why Chiyou’s appearance was blurry—it was because he was worried he would be worshiped by people. </p><p>That’s right—Gods were ultimately influenced by humans. Grid shouldn’t be arrogant just because he accomplished the formidable feat of purifying hell. His cowardly actions were being witnessed all over the world at this moment. The humans who worshiped him would be suspicious and disappointed. </p><p>Grid’s beheading of a god who had already been defeated by Chiyou did more harm than good. The gains were small, while the losses were great. In reality— </p><p>[The God of Joy, ‘Paante,’ has been defeated.] </p><p>[Your level has risen.] </p><p>[Your level has risen.] </p><p>Grid got a large amount of experience for beheading the god. His status didn’t rise at all but he instead faced a warning window. </p><p>[Many people have witnessed your cowardly actions.] </p><p>[If they are disappointed in you and give up their faith, your status might be reduced.] </p><p>“Is there anything left to be disappointed about?” </p><p>Grid cocked his head. He looked like he really didn’t understand. Did he have poor wisdom instead of being born with no talent? </p><p>It was at a time when the gods were whispering. </p><p>“You’ve disappointed them several times already...?” </p><p>Dominion pondered on Grid’s words and looked at the reactions of the humans. Then he immediately came to a conclusion. </p><p>“From every detail, you are different from other gods. In a different sense from Chiyou, you deserve to be an Only One God.” </p><p>The humans who witnessed Grid’s despicable deeds in real time—they didn’t make a fuss at all. They took it for granted. It was as if Grid was inherently a despicable being. </p><p>“To tell the truth, Grid has been strange recently. Since when has he been fair?” </p><p>First of all, the members of the Overgeared guild—they weren’t disappointed in Grid in the slightest. On the contrary, they seemed happy that he showed his true colors. </p><p>“He is a man who doesn’t even keep his promises.” The apostle Braham testified to it. He thought back to Grid of the past, who broke the promise to make a ‘vessel’ and only took the pavranium. </p><p>“He is an unappealing person by nature.” Piaro’s testimony followed.</p><p>“He and Sir Kraugel made a joint attack on me...” Mir added a sentence cautiously. </p><p>“He has always been stingy with a few cows.” Nefelina was very excited. </p><p>“......” Zik confirmed it with silence. </p><p>Even Mercedes, who loved Grid the most, couldn’t defend it and looked away. </p><p>“T-That...” Sariel closed her mouth. In retrospect, Grid wasn’t a fair being. He showed greatness when it was necessary, but he also had moments of narrow-mindedness. Sariel remembered Grid’s insistence that she become a woman every time she met Empress Irene and finally realized. </p><p>“I-I can’t believe the god I serve is a mean and narrow-minded person...!” </p><p>It shouldn’t be like this. It was right that a god be perfect. </p><p>Sariel was filled with nervousness when she suddenly saw the expression of people. The soldiers and knights of the empire were building barriers on every street in the city, and the people were watching the scene with bated breath from a distance—everyone looked calm. It was hard to find anyone who was disappointed in Grid. As the people who had been watching Grid for a long time, they knew Grid’s nature. Nevertheless, they admired and worshiped him. </p><p>“Ahh...” Sariel had a new epiphany. A god didn’t have to be infallible. On the contrary, they could be flawed and therefore, the object of empathy. In the first place, flaws weren’t sins. Wasn’t it too harsh if imperfection was a sin? </p><p>“...I acknowledge and accept that the God I serve is flawed, and I will not be disappointed.” </p><p>I am the most lacking being. Despite being the apostle of a god, I have never played a proper role. Even so, God has fully accepted me. It is also right that I do the same... </p><p>Sariel had a great epiphany and abandoned her hesitation. She stood beside Grid, spreading the feathered wings of several archangels. “I will also be cowardly.” </p><p>“......”</p><p>It was like... things were working out as expected, but he felt bad...? Grid frowned at the apostles’ reaction and turned to Dominion. From the moment he appeared until now, he had maintained a solemn expression befitting his gigantic appearance. Now for the first time, he looked taken aback.</p><p>“A god who maintains his dignity despite being treated like that by his apostles... there has never been one.” </p><p>“......”</p><p>It was Grid who couldn’t react hastily because it was ambiguous whether it was a compliment or a curse. Even that silence became special to Dominion. </p><p>“You don’t intervene in how others evaluate you. Absolute confidence in yourself... it is an attitude that I want to emulate.” </p><p>“......!” </p><p>The eyes of the heavenly gods widened. </p><p>The son of the Goddess—one of the highest beings in Asgard said that he wanted to emulate someone other than the Goddess. A divine punishment fell immediately. It was a divine punishment with a definite form. It was Asura, the Evil God born in hell. He came down and crushed Dominion’s shoulders, which were as wide as the sea. </p><p>“There are many familiar faces. Unfortunately, I don’t have time to exchange words. I’m afraid of Judar’s reproach.” </p><p>The essence of Asura was fighting spirit. He didn’t delay and immediately rushed at Chiyou. </p><p>It was an absolute mess. In the midst of the messy and chaotic situation, Grid refrained from acting recklessly. He had hope that Asura, the ominous mass of variables, could be dealt with. </p><p>However, unexpectedly, Chiyou failed to overwhelm Asura. He was the first to step back in a one-on-one situation. Maybe it was because he was tired of dealing with the heavenly gods and Dominion after Zeratul, or Asura’s martial arts were simply too outstanding. </p><p>Dominion’s eyes were glaring at him fiercely. </p><p>‘He doesn’t seem to like Asura...??’</p><p>Just then, Grid and Dominion’s eyes met in the air. It was an exchange of looks that represented intertwined interests. </p><p>“I’m going crazy.” </p><p>Zeratul had a hunch. </p><p>At the same time— </p><p>‘Did Asura participate in the battle?’ </p><p>Metatron regained their full strength when the Overgeared World’s constraints were lifted and grasped Reinhardt’s situation in real time. They spread their 18 pairs of wings in an attempt to quickly return to the scene and contribute to the subjugation of Chiyou. However, they were unable to fly up and stiffened. </p><p>[I heard your voice the other day. You compared yourself to an Old Dragon.] </p><p>The surroundings turned black. A very large shadow obscured the sun, causing the illusion that night had suddenly come. </p><p>[Let’s check it.] </p><p>The existence that spoke solemnly while raising his two giant eyes. </p><p>The Insane Dragon—no, it was Nevartan, the Old Dragon who was freed from the curse after Baal died.</p><p class="box-notification fs-17">Sᴇarch the <b>NʘvᴇlFɪre.ɴet</b> website on Gøøglᴇ to access chapters of nøvels early and in the highest quality.</p></div><h2>Chapter 1875</h2><div><p>Chapter 1874</p><p>The archangel prior to Raphael—they told Braham that they didn’t know the name Beriache. Additionally, when they descended to the ground and faced Grid for the first time, they were amazed that this world was different from the first world. </p><p>Metatron had been around for a very long time. Unfortunately, it was long enough to witness or experience the Old Dragons in person. </p><p>‘It must be Nevartan.’ </p><p>Even from the position of someone who served the Goddess, Raiders gave off a strange pressure because he was mysterious and dignified, but there was the impression that he was worthy of confrontation. It was also judged that there was a good chance of winning against Bunhelier. </p><p>On the other hand, Nevartan had something that was hard to fathom. It was rumored that he had been ruthless and powerful even before he was reduced to an Insane Dragon, but he was stronger after becoming the Insane Dragon. This meant Metatron couldn’t approach hastily. </p><p>‘...But now the insanity has been cured.’ </p><p>The death of Baal was the trigger. The curse that had been engraved in Nevartan’s mind was extinguished. The essence of Yatan, which had served as the basis for the spell, evaporated when it ceased to play a role. It was the result of Baal’s arrogance in not predicting his own death. He didn’t do it thoroughly. </p><p>Thanks to this, they were able to see the benefits. Metatron saw Nevartan’s two huge eyes that contained cunning and had a smile that didn’t suit their fierce and hideous face. </p><p>‘Let’s be grateful that it isn’t Trauka.’ </p><p>I will be qualified as a Dragon Slayer and have the power to confront Chiyou... </p><p>Flash! </p><p>A beam of light shot from Metatron’s eyes. It was to offset the snort that Nevartan exhaled. The angel’s halo emitted a bright glow in the chain of destruction caused by the collision of fierce energies. </p><p>Hundreds of magic circles appeared in the sky that was darkened due to Nevartan’s shadow. Nevartan failed to stop it. There were 213 shining magic circles. They were all pre-arranged traps. Metatron had completed the magic circles with the possibility of attracting the attention of an Old Dragon. They completely concealed the traces of the magic circle while inwardly waiting for a dragon to fall into the trap. </p><p>It was a few months ago. On the day they descended to the surface and met Grid for the first time, they predicted what was going to happen when they mentioned an Old Dragon openly. Metatron took advantage of the fact that the hearing of the Old Dragons extended across the entire surface. They deliberately targeted the Old Dragons. </p><p>Then today— </p><p>Metatron was convinced that Chiyou’s appearance would have awakened the dragons, and allowed Chiyou’s blow to hit them. They naturally left the scene that would soon become the battlefield of the gods and ended up alone. They created an environment where it was easy for them to hunt their prey. </p><p>In other words, the appearance of Nevartan was an event that took place within Metatron’s expected range. Technically, it was an expected development. </p><p>“”I was about to give up because I thought you weren’t going to show, so I’m grateful. This is also the grace of the Goddess.”” </p><p>The ultimate in divine magic at its finest—the giant Nevartan was bombarded with divine magic that not even the God of Magic, Braham, could reproduce, for it was divine magic that could only be embodied by those who worshiped the Goddess. </p><p>Every single spell was faith. It contained the wishes of those who served the Goddess, and it was a doctrine. It had a weight that overwhelmed the usual rules of magic. </p><p>Nevartan’s magically unfolded shield was smashed. That was it. The dragon’s self-defense wasn’t just magic. Metatron might’ve drawn out exactly 213 magic circles in advance, and even achieved a Trinity with that, but it wasn’t enough to pierce the magic power and scales of an Old Dragon in a single shot. </p><p>Metatron also knew it. Their 18 pairs of wings vigorously waved at the same time that the magic was cast, and they were already in Nevartan’s vicinity. </p><p>Defeating an Old Dragon and the Martial God—Metatron had signed a contract with Judar on this condition and was in an intact state. Their speed and strength were unparalleled after freeing all their wings and regaining the freedom of their body. The speed of inserting a blade into Nevartan’s heart was comparable to that of Chiyou, who was ‘somewhat weakened by erasing his presence.’ </p><p>However, there was a problem. The opponent was too bad. </p><p>[The prestige of the Old Dragons has dropped. I also contributed to the situation, so I don’t want to blame the others. It is just that at this point, my anger is rising.] </p><p>Up to the point when Nevartan went insane, the Old Dragons symbolized invincibility. Either because they were afraid or because they were dirty, even the arrogant gods of Asgard didn’t dare make eye contact with an Old Dragon. The majesty of the Old Dragons was so absolute that even the Goddess finally asked for a truce. </p><p>Yet when Nevartan woke up from his insanity, things had become ridiculous. The majesty of an Old Dragon was so low that even a mere angel treated them as prey to be hunted. The biggest culprit was naturally Nevartan. Nevartan himself was aware of it. </p><p>From the time he fell prey to the demon’s machinations and fell into insanity, there must’ve been a crack in the dignity of the Old Dragons. There was no use making excuses for being deceived by Bunhelier. </p><p>Yes, he admitted that he set the stage. However, that was just a trigger. It was right to say that the reason why things got to this point was the others, not him... </p><p>[What happened while I wasn’t in my right mind? Could it be that Raiders had a duel with the gods due to his obsession with the gods? Or was it Bunhelier, who wasn’t confident in himself, fell for Baal’s deception, whispering good words to demons and relying on them?] </p><p>“”......””</p><p>Metatron watched in vain as the sword inserted in Nevartan’s chest was trapped in a crack in the scales and broke. They were speechless for a moment. It was the aftermath of feeling great admiration. As expected of Nevartan. As the owner of a cold personality, the level of reasoning was high. </p><p>—Although reality was worse than Nevartan’s speculation. </p><p>[...It doesn’t matter. It is a broken prestige. I just need to restore it from now on.] </p><p>Nevartan’s black scales started to glow. Not only was it dyed white, but surprisingly, it exuded divinity. It was Metatron’s divinity. The 213 divine spells that had just bombarded Nevartan bloomed from Nevartan’s scales. It was the moment when the Black Dragon’s ability to absorb and utilize the attributes contained in magic was maximized by Nevartan’s unique power. </p><p>This— </p><p>It was a terrifying sight for Metatron. However, Metatron didn’t shrink back. They felt more anger than fear. </p><p>“”How dare you blaspheme my divinity.“” </p><p>The source of Metatron’s divinity was Rebecca. They felt a strong hatred for Nevartan, who recklessly took and wielded the power of the Goddess. They growled like a beast and had a fierce expression, but Nevartan just snorted like it was ridiculous. </p><p>[Angel of Contract. You don’t know yourself. The reason why you are bound by a contract and have many restrictions is different from what you think.] </p><p>“”You are trying to mislead me with your words.”” </p><p>Metatron scoffed. The reason why they covered their eyes and ears with 18 pairs of wings and sealed their limbs was simple—it was because they were afraid they wouldn’t be able to control their mighty power. It had been like this from the moment they were born. It was a safeguard made by the Goddess herself. There couldn’t be any other reason. </p><p>Nevartan told the truth to Metatron, who believed this. </p><p>[No, you are deeply mistaken. The reason why Rebecca put the conditions of a contract on you is because you are a fool who doesn’t understand the subject.” Considering Rebecca’s personality, she didn’t want to see her creature go out on a rampage and die pitifully.] </p><p>“”Kukuk...!”” </p><p>Metatron couldn’t resist laughing. This time, it was clear mockery. </p><p>When Chiyou, who sided with Hanul, left Asgard—some gods questioned the Goddess’ choice of creating Zeratul rather than liberating Metatron. Through these reactions, Metatron was convinced. They deserved to face Chiyou. It was a belief that wasn’t shaken even after facing Chiyou in person today. </p><p>Therefore, anything Nevartan tried to say sounded like nonsense. </p><p>“”The Old Dragons... Trauka avoided confrontations with Chiyou even in the days when he was running wild. The prestige of the Old Dragons has been on the decline since then. The incident where Raiders toured human restaurants and Bunhelier had a love affair with humans aren’t decisive causes.”” </p><p>Metatron had been around for a very long time. After being removed from their position of archangel, they had turned their back to the world. Still, they knew what the Old Dragons were doing. This was why they had been thoroughly investigating ever since going out into the world recently. </p><p>That’s right—Metatron was obsessed with the Old Dragons. One of their ultimate goals was to destroy Trauka, who brought shame to the Goddess through the pact. </p><p>“”Do you understand what I mean? To use your vulgar tone, it isn’t me who can’t grasp the subject. It is you.”” </p><p>[......?] </p><p>Nevartan’s already huge eyes widened even more. It felt like seeing two full moons up close. </p><p>Nevartan tilted his head. The repercussions were huge. The clouds dispersed without a trace and a terrible storm raged. </p><p>[I can’t put it off any longer. I have to settle things with Trauka.] </p><p>“”......?”” </p><p>Why did it end up this way? This time, it was Metatron’s head who tilted. It didn’t matter whether it was true or not. This wasn’t in Nevartan’s interest. In his mind, he wanted to crush that winged bug at once and get rid of it from in front of his eyes. </p><p>...But it wasn’t easy. It was true that Metatron was strong, unlike an angel. It was inevitable that he would have to spend time trying to kill Metatron. In the current situation, it was an unnecessary loss. </p><p>Nevartan completed the calculations and turned around. He showed his back to Metatron. Metatron was about to aim for this gap that was momentarily revealed, only to stop. They hesitated. </p><p>Nevartan—he possessed both magic power and brute force that was on a different level from Bunhelier. He might be less dignified than Raiders, but he had a charisma that was hard to ignore. In Metatron’s own experience, it was comparable to Trauka. It would be a loss if they fought hastily at this stage. To tell the truth, it was hard to get a glimpse of the odds. </p><p>[Be grateful that I didn’t declare that I would kill you.] </p><p>Dragons were creatures that valued vows very much. If Nevartan had said, ‘I will check your skills’ to Metatron. If he had declared that he would harm Metatron without saying much else. </p><p>Nevartan would’ve definitely killed Metatron. </p><p>[Additionally, keep this in mind. If you hurt Grid... then you will die.] </p><p>Metatron compared themselves to an Old Dragon. Yet Nevartan, who said he would step down without causing harm, cared immensely about Grid’s safety. It was an attitude that seemed to value Grid more highly than the honor of an Old Dragon. </p><p>Why? Metatron didn’t have any doubts. Nevartan’s insanity was eventually cured thanks to Grid. Apart from that, Metatron was aware of Grid’s value. </p><p>“”I will respect him forever as long as he doesn’t tarnish or threaten the honor of the Goddess like Chiyou.”” </p><p>[You will die soon.] </p><p>It happened the moment when Nevartan about to leave after spitting out these meaningful words and snorting... </p><p>[Die! Nevartan!] </p><p>There was a sharp cry and a flash of dark light flew in. It was a Breath. It was the Breath of Evil Dragon Bunhelier. </p><p>At this moment, the expressions that Nevartan and Metatron made were similar. </p><p>Baaaaang! </p><p>The Breath collided with Nevartan and caused a powerful explosion. The surrounding mountains and rivers evaporated. </p><p>[Kuhaha! As expected, it didn’t stop you! Arrogant bastard! Do you think I am the same as before?!] </p><p>Originally, it was the standard to offset a Breath with a Breath. However, Nevartan hit it directly with his body. It was because he judged Bunhelier to be several levels below him. This was exactly what Bunhelier expected, and it was a huge opportunity. </p><p>[Angel over there, cooperate with me in exchange for me sparing your life. If we join forces, we can hunt Nevartan. He is relatively weak because he is still stuck in the past.] </p><p>Due to his madness of many years, there was a gap in Nevartan’s time. He couldn’t develop because he couldn’t sleep or accumulate magic. On the other hand, Bunhelier had grown significantly. He also enjoyed a tremendous rise in status in exchange for killing Baal together with Grid. </p><p>The conclusion was that there was a good chance of winning. It was right to deal a surprise attack first rather than wait for Nevartan’s retaliation. It happened to be a good way to collaborate with a very powerful angel. </p><p>“”......””</p><p>However, the angel’s response was very shaky. It was a look like they wanted to avoid it rather than cooperating. </p><p>Bunhelier laughed.</p><p>[This Nevartan was persistent even when he was insane. Even if you run away from here like this, you will be tracked down someday. So cooperate with me. That is the only way for you to live.] </p><p>“”...Can’t I just leave?”” </p><p>Metatron didn’t bother with Bunhelier. He just looked at Nevartan, who was covered in smoke. </p><p>It was the moment when Bunhelier became displeased and frowned. </p><p>[Bunhelier. I tried to understand the crimes you have committed against me. I understand your position, since you were born weak alone and have low self-esteem. I couldn’t forgive you, but I didn’t intend to kill you... at most, I planned to cut out your heart and chew it in front of you...] </p><p>A gloomy voice rang out. It was filled with Dragon Fear. The fish and monsters fluttering on dry land due to the evaporated river immediately died. </p><p>[But I’m going to have to change that plan.] </p><p>A magnificent sight unfolded. It was a scene in which two Old Dragons, who were bigger than a great mountain, intertwined and fought. </p><p>Metatron was a bit overwhelmed by the sight of monsters crushing each other’s scales with their claws and biting each other’s necks with the teeth that were harder than claws. Gradually, they were swept away. Metatron had to get out of here quickly, but the impact of the battle was so strong that they were stranded in a daze.</p><p class="box-notification fs-17">Sᴇarch the <b>n0vᴇl(ꜰ)ire.ɴet</b> website on Gøøglᴇ to access chapters of nøvels early and in the highest quality.</p></div><h2>Chapter 1876</h2><div><p>Chapter 1875</p><p>‘It is a situation where balance is important.’ </p><p>The war between the gods of Asgard and Chiyou—Grid didn’t want either side to win. He hoped that the fierce battle would continue until both sides were pushed to the limit. Of course, the longer the war lasted, the greater the damage to the city. Still, it was manageable. It was thanks to the gathering of the gods belonging to the Overgeared World. </p><p>Based on the information power of the No Offspring Tomb, they had looked for and appeased the human gods scattered across the continent. They each had extraordinary abilities. There was Garion, the God of the Earth, at the helm. This meant it was possible to minimize the amount of damage to the city. </p><p>‘All the people have already fled.’ </p><p>Mass teleportation was utilized. The message that Sticks and the magicians of the Overgeared Tower had been active had arrived right away. In fact, there was no big problem even if they didn’t flee. It was because both Chiyou and the gods of Asgard were taking care not to injure humans. </p><p>‘This is probably the biggest reason why the Tower of Wisdom didn’t respond.’ </p><p>The Tower of Wisdom also belonged to the Overgeared World. The tower members took Reinhardt’s safety very seriously. However, no one came forward. They seemed to have decided that they weren’t in a position to step up, and Grid respected their judgment. </p><p>‘There is a risk that the intervention of the tower members will change the structure.’ </p><p>At best, it was a situation where Grid created a confrontation between Chiyou and Asgard. He should take advantage of it. </p><p>‘First... we need to whittle away as much power on Asgard’s side as possible before Metatron joins again.’ </p><p>By the way, Chiyou’s feet were actually being tied up. Asura was so outstanding. First of all, his ability itself felt comparable to Chiyou. It was because there were often times when he chased Chiyou’s movements and attacked first before the bells rang. </p><p>Jingle jingle jingle jingle... </p><p>The sound of bells rang non-stop. As the number of collisions between Chiyou and Asura overlapped, it became more and more noisy. </p><p>“At least I know what is going on thanks to that bastard’s bells...” </p><p>Peak Sword stared blankly with a wide mouth for a while before muttering. </p><p>Chiyou and Asura’s fight—in his eyes, all he could see was a flash of light from time to time on the ‘battlefield where there was nothing.’ Even with the status of a transcendent, he couldn’t keep up with the movements of the two gods at all. If the bells hadn’t been heard, he would’ve been swept away by the intermittent shockwaves without knowing why. </p><p>‘It is strange.’ </p><p>Grid’s expression was strange. He followed Chiyou and Asura’s movements exactly and even read their facial expressions. Therefore, it was possible for him to find something strange. </p><p>Chiyou’s expression was dark. There had been a faint smile on his face when he fought Dominion, but now he didn’t seem to be happy at all. No, he seemed displeased. Every time he exchanged blows with Asura, he frowned as if he was brushing off something dirty. </p><p>It was strange. Chiyou inherently respected and cherished the strong. The stronger a being was, the more likely they were to ‘kill him.’ In other words, for Chiyou, being strong was a necessary tool to fulfill his wish. Yet now he was showing disgust toward Asura, who was competing with him. </p><p>‘...Is he reluctant because he thinks he is really going to die?’ </p><p>It was the same with Baal. The one who longed for death because he couldn’t achieve it. As death approached, he struggled to avoid it at all cost. </p><p>Chiyou resembled such an ugly guy...? It happened the moment when Grid was feeling disappointed... </p><p>“It must’ve been Judar who took you to heaven.” </p><p>Chiyou pushed Asura’s fist away with the back of his sword and opened his mouth. A sharp blade touched Asura’s chest. The trajectory of the fist twisted and his chest was naturally exposed. </p><p>“Does he still not realize it? Due to his own greed, he left the Old Dragons and ended up reaching this point.” </p><p>The gushing blood was black. It was too dark even considering the fact that he had his back to the sunset. Despite becoming a god of Asgard, Asura’s blood still had an ominous color. </p><p>“...Kukuk.” Asura laughed. Rather, he used his terribly damaged body as a weapon He snatched Chiyou’s ankles with both hands that were drooping to the ground due to his chest being split in half. </p><p>“There is no need to try. Even if you learn my martial arts, you will only end up losing them to Judar.” </p><p>“Who knows? You don’t know that, do you?” </p><p>Asura gritted his teeth. He snatched Chiyou’s ankle at a strange angle and swung it with all his might. </p><p>Grid’s eyes widened. It was because Chiyou lost his balance for the first time. Of course, it was at the level of being fine. He just stumbled a little bit. No, the word ‘stumble’ was a bit vague. </p><p>Chiyou took one step sideways. That was all. However, it was Asura who induced that one step. </p><p>A rib sticking out of Asura’s split-apart chest stabbed Chiyou’s thigh. It came at a high price. Chiyou’s sword was piercing Asura’s face. However, Asura was persistent. He clung to the rib inserted in Chiyou’s thigh and stuck to him. With one hand, he held onto Chiyou’s sword that was embedded in his skull. </p><p>“First of all, your legs.” </p><p>Then a strange thing happened. </p><p>Bubble bubble! </p><p>Asura’s wounds boiled up like blisters. It was a disgusting sight to the point where it made people with weak stomachs look away. </p><p>Grid didn’t avert his gaze. He witnessed Asura’s wounds healing in an instant. There was even the fact that Asura’s two legs had changed. It was like carving an ideal body. They closely resembled Chiyou’s legs, which stretched out long enough to make people have this thought. </p><p>Chiyou staggered. This time, he really lost his balance and almost collapsed. His legs had also changed their shape. They felt a bit thicker. They were chubby. </p><p>Asura pulled out Chiyou’s sword stuck in his head and broke it. Then he laughed as he stomped his feet a few times. “It feels a lot lighter.” </p><p>“...Was it really taken away?” Grid murmured. He was dubious even though he had witnessed the situation with his own eyes. In the first place, it happened in a flash. For a moment, he had reason to suspect if he had seen it incorrectly. </p><p>“Judar... why are you doing this...?” Unfortunately, he didn’t see it incorrectly. Dominion’s reaction of frowning and gritting his teeth proved it. </p><p>Grid asked bluntly, “Is Asura’s ability given by Judar?” </p><p>“...Probably.” Dominion was about to turn away because he didn’t want to answer. Then he changed his mind and nodded halfway through. “You might know from experiencing it in person in hell, but Asura’s body has a strange variability. It must’ve been of great interest from Judar’s perspective. It wouldn’t be strange if he used the excuse of research to play strange tricks.” </p><p>“I don’t think he is in his right mind? Why does he believe in Asura and want to make him the Martial God? It is hard to believe that Asgard, which couldn’t even control Chiyou, can control an Evil God who has become the Martial God.” </p><p>“Chiyou is a god born from the desires of countless beings. He didn’t belong to Asgard from the beginning, so they couldn’t control it. On the other hand, Asura is in the grasp of Judar.” </p><p>“Can Judar control him?” </p><p>“It is just Judar’s thoughts.” </p><p>“......”</p><p>It didn’t matter whether Asgard could control Asura or not. It wasn’t really an important issue. Grid wouldn’t stand by and watch as Asura took away and replaced Chiyou’s body. Grid held Defying the Natural Order, which Zeratul had returned to him, while Dominion stood beside him. He wasn’t trying to disrupt Grid. The reason he explained the truth was to create a cause to cooperate with Grid. </p><p>There was no dialogue. The two gods leaped at the same time and entered Asura’s vicinity without knowing who arrived first. A sword and spear stabbed from different directions. </p><p>“What is the situation here?” </p><p>Asura folded the leg that originally belonged to Chiyou and snatched Dominion’s spear while looking like he didn’t understand the situation. The spear blade changed trajectory and bounced off Grid’s Defying the Natural Order. </p><p>“Dominion. Aren’t ‘we’ fighting for the Goddess? Don’t you know that we shouldn’t be fighting among ourselves?” </p><p>“Coveting Chiyou’s power isn’t for the Goddess’ sake.” </p><p>“Judar’s thoughts are different.” </p><p>“He must’ve been too greedy.” </p><p>Asura’s body floated in the air. It was the aftermath of Dominion lifting the spear. Grid’s next action followed. </p><p>[All stats will be distributed to strength.] </p><p>The six fusion sword dance was linked in a gorgeous manner. All types of trajectories drawn by Defying the Natural Order caused the illusion of lotus flowers blooming. </p><p>“Um.” Asura was about to implement the footwork skills he had acquired while fighting Chiyou with the two legs he had stolen from Chiyou. Then he changed his mind. He stepped back as hard as he could to avoid Grid’s charge. “I don’t feel like I’m good enough right now. Can you give me a bit more time?” </p><p>“...I will.” </p><p>“Huh? Then I should thank you...” </p><p>Asura was rather flustered by Grid’s easy nod. Then he tilted his upper body in a surprised manner. He responded immediately, but somehow, it was too late. </p><p>His jaw was split in half. Chiyou was standing in front of the puzzled Asura. One leg was raised. Asura’s flesh, which had just been torn off, was hanging from Chiyou’s toe. This was even though parts of his body were forcibly replaced by Asura. Chiyou’s martial ability was still intact. </p><p>“It is better to have changed it.” </p><p>In the first place, Asura’s body was perfect. This was because it was calibrated and reconstructed in real time while fighting Grid’s group in hell. </p><p>Even Asura realized it. “Give it back.” </p><p>‘Crazy bastard.’ </p><p>It was just changed and now he wanted to get it back? Grid clicked his tongue and slipped back. </p><p>He created an environment for Chiyou and Asura to focus on fighting again. The balance that had almost collapsed was corrected again. </p><p>Zeratul approached him and asked, “What are you going to do?” </p><p>“What can I do? I have to kill them with my own hands.” </p><p>“What does that... Asura and Dominion were different from others. It is impossible for you to kill them in one blow just by attacking through the gaps.” </p><p>“Of course, it will be difficult for me alone. But I'm not alone right now.” </p><p>“You...” </p><p>Do you trust me to cooperate? </p><p>Zeratul’s expression became subtle. He didn’t want to admit it, but he was thrilled to realize that he was trusted by Grid. </p><p>A being who made even the arrogant gods of Asgard thrilled—that was Grid’s current position. It was the majesty of the Absolute who killed Baal and purified hell. </p><p>Grid’s explanation followed, “My apostles... in particular, Braham and Mercedes. They will cooperate even without me saying anything. Their personalities aren’t that different from mine.” </p><p>“......?” </p><p>Was he believing in the apostles, not me? </p><p>It happened at the time when Zeratul’s expression crumpled in disappointment... </p><p>-...Grid. </p><p>Someone’s thoughts flowed into Grid’s head. </p><p>‘This...?’ </p><p>-Grid! </p><p>It is Bunhelier. </p><p>‘He is more loyal than I expected.’ </p><p>He was watching. Yes, he had a colleague who was an Old Dragon... Grid smiled in a reassured manner when Bunhelier urged him. </p><p>-What are you doing? Hurry up and send the tower members here. </p><p>“......?” </p><p>-Nevartan is going crazy...! I’m in danger! </p><p>“......”</p><p>Why was a dragon talking nonsense? Grid decided to ignore it and focused on the situation in front of him. There was a belief that if Bunhelier’s words were true, the tower members would take care of it and respond well. </p><p>Chiyou gradually started to overwhelm Asura. Dominion and the other gods stood by and watched the situation. Indeed, many beings were guarding the scene, but Asura was isolated. </p><p>‘Good. Look for an opportunity like this and defeat Asura.’ </p><p>Grid had one more thing to believe in. It was the restrictions of the Overgeared World. It was enough to impose the restrictions when Asura was weakened. This would weaken Asura even more and Grid could kill him without any variables. </p><p>‘Then when Chiyou and Dominion start fighting again, should I deal with them both at once...?’ </p><p>Grid’s thoughts stopped here. It was because he suddenly realized something. </p><p>Chiyou’s movements. They were different from before. It wasn’t that he was tired and dull. Rather, he was much faster and sharper. It felt like he was becoming stronger in real time. </p><p>Zeratul also seemed to understand. He muttered with an expression of incredible frustration, “Should it be around this level...? It is like that guy, Grid...” </p><p>It was to the point where he confided his honest feelings to his rival (?). </p><p>Zeratul was in a state of great shock. For the first time, he realized how much weight the name ‘Martial God’ carried and felt ashamed. </p><p>Grid comforted him, “From my perspective, you are like us.” </p><p>He wasn’t saying nice things because he liked Zeratul. It was given simply before he felt the need to conserve power. Zeratul would be a great boost in power. </p><p>“...That is natural. I am the one who is the true Martial God.” </p><p>‘Yes... it is better than being discouraged.’ </p><p>Grid decided to think positively. It was a twisted situation in many ways. There were too many variables. At times like this, he needed more allies. Grid’s strategy was indeed impressive. </p><p>“So what is the situation?” </p><p>As always— <nfe98f> Sᴇaʀᴄh the N0vᴇlFire(.)nᴇt website on Gøøglᴇ to access chapters of nøvels early and in the highest quality.</nfe98f></p><p>Kraugel came out of the tower later than anyone else and rushed to the scene. The Tower That Grows Stronger As One Climbs It was an instance dungeon. He was half cut off from the outside world, so he needed an explanation of the situation. </p><p>Vantner eagerly explained it, “Um... Chiyou attacked Grid. Then Zeratul and the gods of Asgard came down to help. Grid took the opportunity to kill some gods of Asgard. Soon, Chiyou started to struggle with Asura. So Grid and Dominion worked together to help Chiyou...”</p><p>“......”</p><p>Kraugel suddenly remembered the past version of his mother. </p><p>He became worried about Vantner’s health.</p><p class="box-notification fs-17">Sᴇarch the <b>ɴøvᴇl_Firᴇ.ɴet</b> website on Gøøglᴇ to access chapters of nøvels early and in the highest quality.</p></div><h2>Chapter 1877</h2><div><p>Chapter 1876</p><p>‘It isn’t good.’ </p><p>Grid frowned. </p><p>It was because he noticed that the speed at which Chiyou grew stronger in real time started to exceed his own cognitive speed. It wasn’t until Asura’s arms had already been cut off that he could see how fast Chiyou’s swordsmanship had become. </p><p>The Martial God—he was getting stronger without knowing the limits. </p><p>‘No, I think the word ‘stronger’ is wrong.’ </p><p>It was only now that he was showing off his abilities little by little. </p><p>“...This is what he looks like.” </p><p>The members of the Overgeared guild were agitated. </p><p>A surprisingly ordinary appearance—they started to recognize Chiyou’s face, which had no special features. </p><p>That’s right—Chiyou, who had diminished his presence in order to not be worshiped, was revealing himself little by little. This meant Asura was strong. </p><p>“Help Asura.” Finally, Dominion gave orders to the gods of Asgard. It was still a gentle and solemn expression, but Grid thought that he wouldn’t be comfortable on the inside. He might dislike Asura, but he was in a situation where he was forced to help. There was no way he could be happy. </p><p>Dominion’s spear intercepted Chiyou’s sword. It was the sword that was about to pierce Asura’s throat. </p><p>Asura was feeling relieved when his eyes widened. It was the aftermath of his forehead being pierced. The moment that Dominion intercepted his attack, Chiyou turned and inserted the ink-colored scabbard at an angle. He split the skull of an Absolute like it was tofu. </p><p>“Martial God...”Kraugel trembled and drew a simulation in his head. Would it be possible for him to recreate Chiyou’s movements in the previous situation? Impossible. Impossible. Impossible... </p><p>“Stop it.” Someone’s calloused hand covered Kraugel’s eyes. They were hands made with tenacity and hard work. The hand, which resembled Kraugel’s one, belonged to Sword Saint Muller. </p><p>“The moment you are possessed by him, you will cross a river of no return.” </p><p>Possessed by the Martial God—it was an expression that had existed since a long time ago. It was because there were many followers of the Martial God who were possessed by Zeratul’s secret techniques. Additionally, Chiyou’s influence transcended even Zeratul’s. </p><p>[The knights of the Overgeared Empire are fascinated by the martial arts of the Martial God. The loyalty of the soldiers toward you is on the verge of being degraded to be worthless.] </p><p>The more talented they were, the faster they were possessed by Chiyou. The soldiers with relatively low discernment were still intact, but the knights were greatly influenced. </p><p>“Everyone. Strange.” </p><p>Jude read the suspicious feeling and attacked the knights without hesitation. The sword was wielded with the real intent to kill and some of the startled knights came to their senses. Thanks to this, the situation that had almost become a mess had calmed down a bit. Of course, not all knights came to their senses. Many knights were still possessed by Chiyou and tried to throw themselves forward for him. Asmophel and the former Red Knights stopped them. </p><p>‘There is no need to worry. It is in the range I expected.’</p><p>Grid took solace in the fact that players weren’t possessed by Chiyou. He abandoned miscellaneous thoughts. He thought about the best thing he could do and immediately took action. </p><p>“Grid-sama?” </p><p>Damian, who was guarding one side of the street with the Overgeared members, became taken aback. It was because Grid suddenly seemed to run and leave the battlefield. Soon— </p><p>Ttang! Ttang! Ttaang... </p><p>The sound of hammering came from the building where Grid had rushed to. </p><p>That’s right—Grid took advantage of the fact that this was Reinhardt, in other words, his territory. He made a weapon using the nearby smithy rather than taking out a portable furnace with poor performance. Thanks to this, high-quality battle gear was quickly completed. </p><p>Who was the battle gear for? The top players and apostles of the Overgeared Empire had already acquired their final-level weapons. Of course, the battle gear that Grid made now... </p><p>“Bring it to them.” </p><p>It was for the gods of Asgard. </p><p>The God Hands carried the weapons that had just been completed. </p><p>“......!”</p><p>A god saw the shield shattered helplessly by Chiyou’s sword and prepared for a mortal wound, only to shudder. It was because the shield in his hand suddenly held in his hand completely handled Chiyou’s sword. </p><p>“......”</p><p>It was like a sword ghost. Chiyou, who was silently swinging his sword to slaughter the gods, took a step back. His momentum had obviously weakened. It was understandable. It was because the original plan to aim for the next target after defeating the god in front of him had gone awry. </p><p>For the Martial God, the ‘structure of a fight that goes against my will’ was very strange. It was overwhelming. </p><p>“...Overgeared God. Have you remembered your origin?” </p><p>Jingle jingle jingle! </p><p>Chiyou was smiling slightly when the bells in his ears rang particularly loudly. It was responding to the slightest movements of his facial muscles. It was a scene that showed how sensitive the bells hanging from Chiyou’s body and clothes were. </p><p>“You mean those great GPS are worthless...?” </p><p>Hurent couldn’t help laughing. The bells were signaling Chiyou’s movements. It was rare for a god to respond properly to Chiyou’s movements. </p><p>Caution... </p><p>Hurent had been gulping, only to suddenly look at Haster. “Maybe you are the best opponent for Chiyou?” </p><p>A genius of sound gameplay—perhaps because they thought it was plausible, but the attention of the members of the Overgeared guild instantly focused on Haster. </p><p>“How can that be...” </p><p>It was the moment when Hurent expressed his dismay... </p><p>A few God Hands flew in, grabbed him by the collar, and carried him to the battlefield. </p><p>“Gasp!” </p><p>Grid’s whisper flew to the frightened Haster, who suddenly fell in the middle of the battlefield. </p><p>-Just try it. Believe in yourself. Your talent is real, right? </p><p>“......”</p><p>Grid was right. Haster had come to trust Grid more than himself, so he decided to trust Grid again. He closed his eyes and concentrated in the midst of the gods, who were giving him puzzled looks. </p><p>“Poor, crazy human,” a god lamented. Asgard might not have helped humans during the Great Human and Demon War and even if Rebecca’s true identity was evil, Haster stood among the gods and realized that the gods were definitely different from demons.</p><p>The blessings of the gods poured out. All types of buff effects strengthened him. </p><p>-The gods of Asgard have bestowed blessings on humans in order to get a reward for their worship. It isn’t out of any crazy favor. Poor, crazy human. Don’t be mistaken again and again into repeating a false belief. </p><p>Aldro, the God of Abundance—he was one of the eight gods who descended to Reinhardt along with Zeratul. He had fought Piaro and won. He had reached out to the fallen Piaro and said he would like to learn fieldwork one day. Now his will poured into Haster. </p><p>It was somewhat cynical. However, there was no glimpse of malice. It came as genuine advice. </p><p>-The only god you can trust and worship is Grid. </p><p>“...Why do you say that?” </p><p>-I am just saying what I have seen and felt. </p><p>Taking his eyes off a madman whose eyes were still closed, Aldro looked at Zeratul in the distance. It was a face that had lost its poison. He looked good now compared to the days when he was struggling to prove himself and be recognized. </p><p>Did he become attached to Zeratul after learning martial arts from him? Aldro couldn’t look badly at Zeratul, who relied on Grid, and took a stance. Both hands were armed with the gauntlets that had just been handed to him by the God Hands. </p><p>“Kuek...!” </p><p>Haster hastily stretched out his sword. It was toward Aldro’s left flank. Aldro responded. He ignored Haster’s sword stabbing at him and stretched out his fist to the left. </p><p>Jingle. </p><p>The bell sound that Haster heard earlier rang in Aldro’s ears with a very slight delay. </p><p>Baaaang! </p><p>Aldro’s fist slammed into Chiyou’s sword. </p><p>“Hoh?” Chiyou admired it. He looked at Haster, who blocked his sword, not Aldro. “Did you hear and read it correctly?” </p><p>“...Uraaaaat!” </p><p>Haster squeezed out all his strength and swung his sword. It was to lift up Chiyou’s foot, which had been pressing down on the back of his sword. It was impossible. It felt like he was carrying a great mountain. The sword didn’t move despite him carrying the blessings of the gods on his back. </p><p>Haster changed his plans. He used the authority of the Red Sage to cast buffs on Aldro. Thanks to this, Aldro succeeded in shaking off Chiyou’s sword and linked an attack. He accurately used the martial arts he had learned from Zeratul. </p><p>Jingle. </p><p>Chiyou’s collar crumpled as a fist brushed against it. No, it was ripped beyond being crumpled. The cause was the claw that stuck out from the back of the hand of the gauntlet that Aldro was wearing. </p><p>Haster’s help, Zeratul’s martial arts, and Grid’s item—Aldro was experiencing the Trinity. It was complete. </p><p>In an instant, he transcended his limits and slammed his fist into Chiyou’s chest. </p><p>“There are talents that bloom at any moment.” It was like humming a song. Chiyou was talking happily as he broke Aldro’s wrist and kicked him in the abdomen. </p><p>“......!” </p><p>Aldro collapsed without even being able to scream. Chiyou’s sword moved in a diagonal line. It dug toward the neck of the kneeling Aldro. </p><p>At this moment— </p><p>Ting. </p><p>A certain seed flew out and collided with Chiyou’s sword. At the same time— </p><p>“Super Growth.” </p><p>The rapidly growing beanstalk pushed Chiyou away.</p><p>Dominion’s spear, which had been inserted just in time, added its power and forced Chiyou away from this position. </p><p>“Farming, I can’t wait to learn.” Aldro struggled to get up and gave a thumbs up. It was toward Piaro’s presence that he felt in a corner of the battlefield. </p><p>Braham frowned. “Don’t play petty house games with those you have to kill someday.” </p><p>Piaro, who took back Natural State, which had been raised to the extreme, replied with a bitter expression. “At the very least, aren’t we on the same side right now?” </p><p>“That isn’t right. In a few minutes, we’ll be enemies again.” </p><p>“I’ll cut him at that time. I am a farmer. I thoroughly distinguish between public and private matters.” </p><p>“......”<nf3641> Sᴇaʀᴄh thᴇ ɴovᴇlꜰirᴇ.nᴇt website on Gøøglᴇ to access chapters of nøvels early and in the highest quality.</nf3641></p><p>Did a farmer make a strict distinction between public and private matters? Braham, the God of Wisdom, couldn’t say anything because this was an area he didn’t know. </p><p>Meanwhile, the battle was intensifying. The gods received Grid’s battle gear that was supplied in real time and the number of times they handled Chiyou’s attacks increased. Thanks to this, Dominion went on a rampage. He focused entirely on attacking and pressing Chiyou. </p><p>Asura used this time to finish recovering and joined in. Chiyou’s dopo was repeatedly ripped. Finally, Asura smashed Dominion’s spear into Chiyou’s heart with his foot. A tremendous acceleration was added and it pierced Chiyou’s body. </p><p>“......” </p><p>The soaring spear attracted everyone’s attention. Dominion’s spear emitted a brilliant glow to prevent the setting sun from reaching it and was clearly conveying something. The Only One God had come to an end here today. </p><p>“...Be prepared.” Braham was staring at the limp Chiyou, who was pierced by the huge spear, and ordered the apostles. The knights, who were possessed by Chiyou and came to their senses after seeing Grid’s performance, and the members of the Overgeared guild prepared for battle with their respective forces. </p><p>Their targets were the gods of Asgard. As Grid was locked in the smithy and producing battle gear for the gods, Chiyou was defeated and the balance collapsed. </p><p>The battle between Absolute was quickly decided as usual. It was probably out of Grid’s expectations. It had to be fixed. </p><p>It happened the moment when everyone at the scene was getting ready... </p><p>“He suddenly became handsome?” </p><p>Peak Sword and Vantner shouted simultaneously while looking betrayed. It was while looking at Chiyou’s face, who was still hanging limp from the blade of the spear. Finally— </p><p>Except for Grid, other people also saw Chiyou’s true self. The Martial God was prepared to be worshiped and lifted all restrictions. </p><p>“Did you push me this far with a small amount of influence?” Chiyou slowly raised his head, eyes fixed on the building where Grid was located. He didn’t bother to look at the spear that pierced his heart and Dominion holding it. Dominion gritted his teeth and swung the spear. Chiyou was about to be crushed to the ground. But when the spear was thrust into the ground, Chiyou was standing on the spear. </p><p>His back was to the astonished Dominion and he fired off a flash of light with his sword. Then Asura’s body was split into dozens of pieces and he hastily retreated. The gods, the apostles of Grid, the members of the Overgeared guild, and the valiant soldiers of the Empire couldn’t close their mouths. </p><p>They took a step back. Only Jude rushed in. Jude’s greatsword, which resembled a shark, drew a large horizontal line toward Chiyou. However, Jude didn’t feel anything at the tip of his blade. He suddenly realized that his vision had moved away from the ground and he was puzzled. </p><p>Grid’s voice entered his ears. “I told you to cherish your life.” </p><p>Jude’s large body slammed into one of the buildings. Grid had grabbed him by the back of the neck and threw him away. It was incredibly fast. </p><p>Zeratul, the gods of Asgard, and Dominion, looked somewhat incredulous. </p><p>“Martial God Chiyou.” Grid had overcome the limits of speed by going all-in on agility. He arrived in front of Chiyou and then went all-in on stamina. He was fully armed with dragon armor and raised his arms leisurely. “Cut first. In return, I’ll do it next time.” </p><p>“It will be an interesting contest.” Chiyou showed interest. </p><p>“Ah.” The members of the Overgeared guild sighed. </p><p>Between the long, thick fingers of Grid, who was grinning with relief, Doran’s Ring was shining as the cooldown time ended.</p><p class="box-notification fs-17">Sᴇarch the <b>ɴ0velFɪre.nᴇt</b> website on Gøøglᴇ to access chapters of nøvels early and in the highest quality.</p></div><h2>Chapter 1878</h2><div><p>“Don’t talk nonsense.”&nbsp;</p><p>The repercussions were huge.&nbsp;There was a lot of opposition to Grid, who asked Chiyou for a&nbsp;fair&nbsp;exchange of blows.&nbsp;</p><p>“The opponent is Chiyou. It is nothing but arrogance to handle him alone, no matter how you are.”&nbsp;</p><p>Zeratul and Dominion were the main ones.&nbsp;They criticized Grid before anyone else could say anything.&nbsp;It wasn’t because they were worried about Grid’s safety.&nbsp;They feared that Chiyou would swallow Grid and become even more powerful.&nbsp;</p><p>“You don’t deserve to give Grid your opinion.”&nbsp;</p><p>“......!”&nbsp;</p><p>The sword that Chiyou wielded blew away Dominion’s entire body, along with his spear.&nbsp;The shockwave was enormous.&nbsp;</p><p>Grid took a few steps back.&nbsp;Zeratul, who was near Dominion, couldn’t back away and fell.&nbsp;</p><p>“Such a disgrace to me...”&nbsp;Zeratul sat down and gritted his teeth.&nbsp;However, he didn’t dare to glare at Chiyou.&nbsp;</p><p>The Martial God who had revealed his true body.&nbsp;He was completely different, but also similar to Rebecca, the Goddess of Light.&nbsp;The Goddess made others bow to her with warm benevolence, while Chiyou made them bow with overwhelming force.&nbsp;</p><p>Zeratul was ashamed.&nbsp;He wanted to erase from his memory the entire time he had been living as the Martial God.&nbsp;</p><p>“It is unsightly.”&nbsp;Grid’s voice was heard.&nbsp;They were cooperating now, but they were obviously enemies.&nbsp;It was even the one Zeratul hated the most.&nbsp;However, Zeratul knew the fact that countless beings had been fascinated by him, regardless of species, status, or inclination.</p><p>‘You... what sweet words are you going to whisper?’&nbsp;</p><p>At this point, Grid must be trying to appease him to make him an ally.&nbsp;Zeratul expected the obvious development.&nbsp;Zeratul thought Grid would comfort him with his tongue and dazzle him.&nbsp;Yes, he knew it was obvious, but he kept his ears open and waited.&nbsp;It was a moment when even the smallest comfort was too much.&nbsp;</p><p>Now he had realized the gap with Chiyou.&nbsp;It was hard for him to stay sane.&nbsp;He was on the verge of collapse due to facing the truth that he had been ignoring.&nbsp;He wanted to rely on someone else, no matter who it was.&nbsp;</p><p>Grid grinned at Zeratul, who was inwardly looking forward to it.&nbsp;“It is funny to see you, who always acts like you are the best, become frustrated after meeting the real thing. Should I be glad that you have admitted that you are nothing but a fake and have become humble?”&nbsp;</p><p>“...You!”&nbsp;An emotional Zeratul jumped up.&nbsp;His two legs, which had been relaxed, stood up again.&nbsp;He stood up again just before his pride, which had been honed by ignoring the truth, was crushed.&nbsp;</p><p>“That is how you should be, Zeratul.”&nbsp;Grid chuckled.&nbsp;He felt more at ease that he paid back a bit of what Zeratul had done for him in the Prison of Eternity.&nbsp;He felt like he could focus more on the confrontation.&nbsp;</p><p>“I’m sorry.”&nbsp;</p><p>It was after the disturbance was over.&nbsp;Grid faced Chiyou again, only to hear unexpected words.&nbsp;An apology flowed out of Chiyou’s mouth.</p><p>“I know that my obsession with my selfish wish has put many people, including you, in a difficult position.”&nbsp;</p><p>Chiyou withdrew his sword.&nbsp;The sword that had been used so far was placed back in the dark sheath held in his left hand.&nbsp;Was he finally coming to his senses and stopping the fight?&nbsp;It happened as people were looking forward to it...&nbsp;</p><p>Chiyou tightened his grip on the hand holding the sheath.&nbsp;Then the dark-colored sheath that smashed Asura’s skull like tofu was flattened entirely along with the sword that had received Dominion’s spear hundreds of times.&nbsp;The Martial God revealed his true nature and treated even the most treasured sword as worthless.&nbsp;</p><p>Jingle.&nbsp;</p><p>Chiyou’s&nbsp;dopo&nbsp;fluttered and a new sword appeared.&nbsp;No, it wasn’t suitable to be called a sword.&nbsp;It was more like a club, a long, thin club made of pure metal.&nbsp;It was bumpy and coarse.&nbsp;</p><p>“Are you going to beat me with a rod after apologizing?”&nbsp;</p><p>Grid&nbsp;frowned&nbsp;with displeasure.&nbsp;He thought Chiyou was putting away the sword before the start of the confrontation. Now he doubted Chiyou’s intentions when Chiyou pulled out the rod.&nbsp;Surprisingly, Dominion cleared up the misunderstanding.&nbsp;</p><p>“Pair. That is Chiyou’s favorite weapon.”&nbsp;</p><p>“Pair...?”&nbsp;</p><p>“What started out as a mere piece of metal has been transformed into what it is today after being with Chiyou over the years."</p><p>The long, crude iron rod contained Chiyou’s experience.&nbsp;It was a completed form that followed the trajectory Chiyou had swung so far.&nbsp;It might seem like a simple iron rod to others, but it was the best customized weapon for Chiyou.&nbsp;</p><p>“He is sincere. You had better be prepared.”&nbsp;</p><p>“...You are telling me to be serious.”&nbsp;Grid chuckled.&nbsp;He still had his arms outstretched.&nbsp;He didn’t take any stance and looked more arrogant than Chiyou.&nbsp;“I have always been serious."</p><p>[Only One God Grid...]&nbsp;</p><p>“Stop.”&nbsp;Grid stopped the epic.&nbsp;</p><p>After the defeat of Baal, Grid had plenty of time.&nbsp;It was a time he used to closely analyze and study the rewards he had earned.&nbsp;What he paid attention to was the ‘common public characteristics’ gained after he unexpectedly broke through level 1,000.&nbsp;</p><p>There was Stats Redistribution, an ability that anyone could gain if they reached level 1,000.&nbsp;It was an ability that would inevitably become less rare at some point.&nbsp;Once time passed and level 1,000 became common, it would be treated as a common ability.&nbsp;</p><p>However, Grid took note of that.&nbsp;He appreciated the fact that he could ‘intervene in the system.’&nbsp;The ability to redistribute stats that they had already distributed at any time.&nbsp;It was a clear violation of the rules established by the existing system.&nbsp;It suggested the possibility that the players could be freed from the system-created rules.&nbsp;</p><p>It wasn’t just a possibility.&nbsp;</p><p>Strength, speed, and stamina—all types of stat values that reached the limit created by the system even after becoming an Absolute were transcended by using Stats Redistribution.&nbsp;This was the reason why Amoract died without being aware of Grid’s attack.&nbsp;</p><p>Grid thought about it.&nbsp;Reaching level 1,000 was actually a very difficult achievement.&nbsp;So in return for reaching level 1,000, he was completely freed from the regulations of the system.&nbsp;</p><p>[The epic will stop being written according to your will.]&nbsp;</p><p>‘As expected... it is possible.’&nbsp;</p><p>His hypothesis became true.&nbsp;Even the epics that used to rise in certain situations regardless of Grid’s will could now be controlled by Grid.&nbsp;</p><p>“It is a wise decision,” Chiyou praised him.&nbsp;</p><p>Chiyou regained his composure after pouring out his energy fighting Asura and Dominion.&nbsp;He glimpsed the fact that Grid still wasn’t strong enough to kill him.&nbsp;It was a fight where defeat was obvious from Grid’s point of view.&nbsp;There was no benefit in publicizing it.&nbsp;On the contrary, it would be a disaster that would only increase Chiyou’s status.&nbsp;</p><p>“As I said before, I want to apologize to you.”&nbsp;</p><p>An apology from the Martial God.&nbsp;</p><p>“I’ll increase your knowledge as an apology.”&nbsp;</p><p>Chiyou closed the gap with Grid.&nbsp;The bells didn’t ring.&nbsp;His movements were quiet.&nbsp;The Pair he raised his head fell toward Grid without any noise.&nbsp;It was the Martial God’s blow with all his strength.&nbsp;Grid couldn’t recognize it even though it happened in front of his eyes.&nbsp;</p><p>“......!!”&nbsp;</p><p>Blood gushed from Grid’s mouth and nose as his eyes widened.&nbsp;His wide chest was crushed along with the dragon armor.&nbsp;</p><p>“I hope that what you learn in this moment will help you harm me in the future.”&nbsp;Chiyou’s whisper was faintly audible.&nbsp;</p><p>[You have suffered catastrophic damage.]&nbsp;</p><p>He entered the immortal state.&nbsp;It was a disaster that occurred for allowing a single blow.&nbsp;His stats that went all-in on stamina and his absolute defense were lacking.&nbsp;</p><p>Chiyou’s back entered Grid’s red-tinged vision.&nbsp;He was about to leave.&nbsp;</p><p>That’s right.&nbsp;Chiyou realized it after grasping the level of Grid, who couldn’t even handle one blow.&nbsp;Unfortunately, at the current level, Grid couldn’t hurt him in any way...&nbsp;In other words, any further confrontation was pointless.&nbsp;</p><p>This was what Chiyou thought.&nbsp;</p><p>Flash!&nbsp;</p><p>Defying the Natural Order, wielded by Grid, drew a half moon.&nbsp;It was a trajectory optimized for slashing.&nbsp;Subsequently, it became a straightforward stab before transforming into a giant sword for a final cut.&nbsp;</p><p>“......!!”&nbsp;</p><p>“......!!”&nbsp;</p><p>Everyone at the scene was shocked.&nbsp;It was because blood gushed out from dozens of bloody cuts on Chiyou’s body.&nbsp;</p><p>The sword that Grid wielded viciously—Chiyou paid dearly for allowing it to hit because he thought it was just Grid venting his anger.&nbsp;</p><p>“You said to exchange blows once...”&nbsp;Braham&nbsp;was stunned by Chiyou’s completely devastated state and clicked his tongue.&nbsp;</p><p>Chiyou was also making a puzzled expression.&nbsp;“You slashed me 47 times and stabbed me 9 times...?”&nbsp;</p><p>“It is a six fusion sword dance, so it is one blow.”&nbsp;</p><p>The promise to cut each other once—Grid used the six fusion sword dance as an excuse to violate it and looked imposing.&nbsp;Additionally—&nbsp;</p><p>Flash!&nbsp;</p><p>A huge light fell straight down from the sky and struck the top of Chiyou’s head.&nbsp;</p><p>[Another Tomb]&nbsp;</p><p>[Recreates the Tomb

silence that lasted for a while, Grid explained, “It is an uncontrollable power.”&nbsp;</p><p>“...Yes.”&nbsp;Chiyou had a strange expression as he slowly pulled himself up.&nbsp;He silently observed the wounds on his body.&nbsp;He was recovering quickly, but a few deep wounds seemed like they would remain as scars for a few minutes.&nbsp;He felt that the curse of eternal life had weakened for a moment.&nbsp;It reminded him of death.&nbsp;</p><p>“I think I was beaten because I was rude.”&nbsp;Chiyou smiled slightly and concluded.&nbsp;Rather than criticizing Grid, he was filled with pleasure and gradually faded away.&nbsp;“Our next meeting will solely be of your own volition.”&nbsp;</p><p>It wasn’t a prophecy.&nbsp;It was a declaration that he wouldn’t act rashly again.&nbsp;Grid was relieved thanks to this but he didn’t say thank you.&nbsp;It already took a lot of patience not to swear.&nbsp;Soon—&nbsp;</p><p>Jingle...&nbsp;</p><p>Chiyou disappeared from the scene, leaving only the faint sound of bells.&nbsp;</p><p>“Don’t miss him!”&nbsp;</p><p>Dominion and the gods of Asgard followed.&nbsp;Thousands of troops were waiting beyond the golden clouds that formed a staircase.&nbsp;It was the army trained and led by Dominion, the God of War.&nbsp;They had been waiting silently out of fear of harming human lives.

Mountains rose all over the wilderness and deep hills were transformed into river-like lakes. It was the aftermath of the fall of a giant dragon. </p><p>The entity called the Evil Dragon among the Old Dragons, Bunhelier. Recently, he helped Grid in the fight against Baal and was worshiped as a hero. Contrary to popular assessments that praised him as invincible, his appearance was disastrous. He was repeatedly trampled on by a dragon that was one head taller than him. </p><p>[Groan...] </p><p>Heavy rain poured down in the aftermath of the explosion of magic in all forms. Bunhelier was submerged in the formed lake and could barely raise his head. His large eyes, which were golden as if they contained the sun, were dyed black. They were projecting the black Breath that was flying right in front of him. </p><p>Bunhelier’s view of the landscape spun around. He was hit by Nevartan’s Breath, which continued flying to devastate the mountain range that had been created around Bunhelier’s crash site. His head spun several times. A normal creature would’ve had his neck bones completely crushed to death. </p><p>[Bunhelier. I know you are pitiful and pathetic. You are a product of inferiority that makes misjudgments every time. It is worthless to point out all the mistakes you have made, for every mistake is the result of incompetence.] </p><p>The years of insanity and wandering. Nevartan didn’t consider it a great waste. It was because he knew his value was immutable. No tricks or time could detract from the ‘I’ that he declared. This was the heart of an Old Dragon. </p><p>‘A being that even the Absolutes look up to.’ </p><p>Metatron read Nevartan’s mind and shuddered. They noticed that the reason why the Old Dragon didn’t confront Chiyou wasn’t because they lacked courage. </p><p>‘...Then why?’ </p><p>Why did Trauka, who ran around uncontrollably and hunted the gods of Asgard, avoid a confrontation with Chiyou? What external force was at work? Was there such a thing as an external force that could control the Old Dragons? </p><p>Metatron was filled with new questions when they suddenly came to their senses. It was due to the disturbance caused by Bunhelier. The sight of Bunhelier struggling to raise his submerged body in the lake resembled a creature rolling around in the mud. How could it be the same Old Dragon...? </p><p>This was the cause of his misjudgment... </p><p>Eventually, Bunhelier shouted at Metatron, who hated and resented him. </p><p>[Useless angel...! How long are you going to be mesmerized?] </p><p>“”......””</p><p>What shamelessness did this creature have to ask for cooperation? Metatron wondered before soon coming to a conclusion. They noticed that low self-esteem and the resulting nervousness and victim mentality had helped shape Bunhelier’s unconventional personality. </p><p>‘He looks like Zeratul.’ </p><p>Just in time, a report arrived that Zeratul hoped to join the Overgeared World. It was predicted that Grid wouldn’t reject him. Metatron’s heart swelled. </p><p>‘He is truly God the Father.’</p><p>A god who didn’t hate those who were lacking and instead gathered them. Metatron truly admired Grid. They highly appreciated the fact that Grid gave such an insignificant Bunhelier the chance to defeat Baal with him. </p><p>‘Therefore, the Goddess supported Grid.’ </p><p>The first time they saw Grid, Metatron recognized it immediately. The blessing of the Goddess on Grid. It had been a force that supported Grid since he was only the lowest status being. It would’ve helped Grid overcome all the trials he went through. Therefore, Metatron was favorable to Grid. Not only were they fascinated by Grid’s feats, but they also recognized Grid as a similar existence. </p><p>The Goddess’ apostle... </p><p>[This damn bastard...] </p><p>Bunhelier growled. He harbored hatred for Metatron, who ignored his pleas for help and had other thoughts. </p><p>Metatron ignored him to the end. It was judged that Bunhelier would die soon anyway. In reality— </p><p>Magic power was repeatedly condensing in front of Nevartan’s snout. At first glance, it was the precursor to more than a dozen Breaths. </p><p>[But Bunhelier. You obviously crossed the line. I didn’t expect you to repent for your mistakes, but to think you would challenge me... in a sense, you have exceeded my predictions. Maybe I should commend you.] </p><p>After it was overlapped, dozens of Breaths formed a giant sphere. It was affected by Nevartan’s movement as he shook his head. </p><p>Unification—no matter how many Breaths Nevartan created or how their power soared, they became an absolute force when combined as one. It wasn’t separate so the operation speed was very slow. </p><p>[No, your attitude of challenging me head-on without playing tricks is beyond forgiveness. Give up on any help. Die.] </p><p>Flash! </p><p>The sphere of dark magic power, condensed like a giant planet, glowed. </p><p>‘Really. This is real death.’ </p><p>Bunhelier sensed his death. It was said that he was born weak among the Old Dragons. Bunhelier wasn’t so stupid that he couldn’t distinguish his end. He had developed in return for defeating Baal with Grid. He was the only one of the Old Dragons to raise his level, which was at the limit, and all his stats rose. His body had become a bit bigger than before, so he reached Nevartan’s eye level to a certain extent. It was easy to see that he couldn’t handle the bombardment of Breaths that spread like a beam of light and filled his vision. </p><p>[Shit...] </p><p>If he had the same power as Raiders, he would’ve gone back in time and not challenged Nevartan.</p><p>[I want to complain!] </p><p>If he had Trauka’s physical body— </p><p>He would’ve flown through the bombardment of Breaths and bitten Nevartan on the neck. </p><p>[Why only me...!!] </p><p>Even at the last moment, Bunhelier cursed the fate that had been bestowed upon him. He didn’t blame Grid. Considering that person’s personality, it was unlikely Grid would’ve deliberately ignored his request for help.</p><p>‘I guess he couldn’t shake off Chiyou.’ </p><p>That’s right—Bunhelier knew what was happening with Grid. Nevertheless, he got into an accident. He was overconfident in the power he had developed... </p><p>‘It is worse than dogs.’ </p><p>It was over. As Bunhelier’s resentment was directed at the tower members, who never showed up, a refraction of light occurred in all directions. The trajectory of the Breaths bombarding Bunhelier was twisted in all directions. </p><p>[...Hmm?] </p><p>A stream of blood flowed from Bunhelier’s cheek as he tilted his head. It was the aftermath of being cut by his own Breath, which was returned to him. </p><p>‘Is it the tower members?’ </p><p>Death, which couldn’t be avoided, arbitrarily missed him... </p><p>Bunhelier was puzzled for a while without understanding the sudden situation. Then he quickly grasped the situation. He smiled slightly as he felt an ignorant liking toward the tower members whom he had just been blaming and cursing at. </p><p>‘Biban? No. That was... it is correct to interpret it as Hayate himself coming.’ </p><p>It was the Breath of an Old Dragon. It was also an existence who reflected dozens of Breaths of such power. It couldn’t be anyone other than the Dragon Slayer. Grid couldn’t do it either. </p><p>[I believed in...] </p><p>It was only natural for the tower members to help him, a fellow colleague of Grid. Bunhelier became energetic and was about to shout Hayate’s name, only to stop. It was due to the presence that appeared in front of his eyes. The identity of the great being who reflected Nevartan’s Breaths and nullified the will of an Old Dragon wasn’t Hayate. It was a ‘kin’ with transparent glass-like scales and even a lower status, Cranbel... </p><p>[...What? Hayate was Cranbel?]</p><p>He had just been ready to die. Bunhelier, who was already in a state that wasn’t intact. </p><p>A top dragon helping an Old Dragon? Bunhelier was momentarily confused in the face of an improbable, transcendent event. </p><p>“”......?”” </p><p>Metatron was the only one shaken by Bunhelier’s nonsense. </p><p>Dragon Slayer Hayate—it was one of the names that appeared as ‘someone to be familiar with’ after their long period of seclusion. But his true identity was a dragon? </p><p>“”The true identity of the Dragon Slayer is actually a dragon...? How many of your own kind have you been preying on?”” <nf7afe> S~ᴇaʀᴄh the NʘvᴇlFirᴇ.nᴇt website on Gøøglᴇ to access chapters of nøvels early and in the highest quality.</nf7afe></p><p>[...Cloaked Dragon. You are a noble child. Why do you meddle in the affairs of adults?] </p><p>Nevartan maintained his composure while the confused Bunhelier and the angels showed disgraceful appearances. He wasn’t obsessed with the ‘result’ of Cranbel interfering with him and was instead interested in why Cranbel came forward. </p><p>Cranbel didn’t budge. </p><p>[It is because most of the surface is Grid’s territory.] </p><p>It was a brief and concise explanation. </p><p>That’s right—most of the surface belonged to the Overgeared World. To add some exaggeration, it could be said that all of the surface, except for the dragon lairs, belonged to Grid. Of course, the dragons didn’t have to be conscious of this, especially the Old Dragons. It was because the ground they stepped on was theirs. </p><p>However, Nevartan’s position was unique. </p><p>[Nevartan, don’t you owe Grid?]</p><p>[... That is right. I almost bothered Grid. I’m sorry.] </p><p>Nevartan had just assessed the extent of the Breath’s explosion. It was likely that several human villages hundreds of kilometers from here were destroyed. </p><p>[But Cranbel. Why are you helping me?] </p><p>It was Bunhelier whose life was saved, but Nevartan recognized that he had been helped. It showed how much he valued his relationship with Grid. </p><p>[It is even while using the power of God. Didn’t you intend to live a normal life?] </p><p>““......?!”” </p><p>A chill went down Metatron’s spine. It was because it was very rare for dragons to clearly use the title ‘God.’ The god they were talking about was likely to be ‘it.’ The Dragon God, also known as the Refractive Dragon. </p><p>A ‘concept’ that had been opposing the Gods of the Beginning every time the end came. Metatron, who recalled it from the moment they saw Cranbel’s transparent scales refracting Nevartan’s breath, felt overcome with a certain sense of duty. They felt obligated to get rid of Cranbel right away. </p><p>However, they couldn’t come forward hastily. It was because of the people who arrived at the scene just in time. </p><p>“Evil Dragon Bunhelier. Your life is tenacious, just like an Old Dragon.” </p><p>The blond-haired man standing next to Sword God Biban. It was the real Hayate. He was the first human to attain the status of an Absolute. He was the ‘only one’ until Biban became the Sword God. In any case, now he was armed with Grid’s work. He came to everyone in a special way. </p><p>[You are really late...!!] </p><p>Bunhelier looked around and lost his temper. He managed to restore his wounded body and flew to Biban and Hayate’s side. </p><p>The hesitant Metatron also moved toward them. “”Dragon Slayer. There are three of your prey here. I, Metatron, the Angel of Contract, will help you due to my awe of you.”” </p><p>[This useless angel is stupid... it isn’t three, it is two.] </p><p>Nevartan stared at Bunhelier, who argued shamelessly with the angel to the end, and finally snorted. </p><p>[I’m tired of this. Forget it. Let’s stop here.] </p><p>“Thank you.” Hayate bowed politely. Ironically, it was the Dragon Slayer, who had the power to oppose them, who properly valued and respected the Old Dragons. </p><p>Nevartan’s eyes were fixed on Cranbel as he activated the return magic. </p><p>[I look forward to hearing from you next time.] </p><p>These were the final words. Nevartan’s appearance and energy disappeared like it was a lie. All that remained was for the situation to be finished. However, Metatron didn’t want to miss this opportunity. He shot a beam of light while rushing at Cranbel, who was alone. </p><p>“”If you are really the descendant of the Refractive Dragon... no, there is no way there can be any descendants. Still, you can’t be kept alive.””</p><p>[...What do you want to do?] </p><p>Bunhelier frowned and Biban made the same expression.</p><p class="box-notification fs-17">Sᴇarch the <b>NøvᴇlFirᴇ(.)nᴇt</b> website on Gøøglᴇ to access chapters of nøvels early and in the highest quality.</p></div>
